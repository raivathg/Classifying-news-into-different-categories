["By Luke Edwards 7 00PM BST 14 Apr 2013 Comments Although there was no trouble in the ground Newcastle fans many of whom had watched the match in city centre pubs tried to confront Sunderland s supporters as they were escorted by police to Newcastle Central Station to board trains and metros Police dressed in riot gear managed to hold them off during a series of skirmishes and were pelted with glass bottles as a result The violence led to 27 arrests while three officers were injured one of whom needed hospital treatment An eye witnesses told the Northern Echo It was terrifying and complete chaos The fans were chucking flares bits of pavement rocks anything they could get their hands on Wheelie bins were set alight causing the police horses to rear up in fear I don t know if anybody has been hurt or not Newcastle United 0 Sunderland 3 Newcastle United v Sunderland as it happened Premier League table Di Canio s daughters targets of abuse The Tyne Wear derbies that leave lasting impression Di Canio I ll eclipse Newcastle There was also anger among home supporters during the game when a smoke canister was thrown from the seats above them that were occupied by away fans The most serious incident involved a group of Newcastle fans in Central Station attempting to confront Sunderland supporters but they were intercepted by officers from British Transport Police said a Northumbria Police spokeswoman During this incident missiles were thrown at the officers which resulted in three injuries to officers one of them requiring assessment at hospital Police confirmed they received reports of smoke canisters being released before and during the match Newcastle fans were also involved in a series of sporadic incidents of disorder in the city centre following the match the spokeswoman added The violence is an indication of the volatile nature of this fixture which always requires a huge police operation to prevent the two sets of supporters from clashing and hints at the pressure Newcastle s manager Alan Pardew is now under Sunderland boss Paolo Di Canio his trousers ruined by the knee slide celebration of his team s second goal described it as a beautiful derby but this was as ugly as it comes for Newcastle It s going to affect the rest of our season because to our fans that is everything admitted Pardew It s not so much about the fans sticking with us it s about us making sure we put performances on between now and the end of the season that will help us ease the memory of this result It s not going to go away We will have to wear it and probably next year as well that s what happens when you lose one of these games We are under no illusions of the responsibility we have to our fans we know what this means to them and we have let them down It s up there with the worst moment I ve had here None of that mattered to Di Canio whose celebrations on the touchline and again after the game were typically dramatic By the time he spoke to the media though the former Swindon Town manager had found a sense of perspective This result doesn t decide the rest of the season he said The adrenaline was pumping on the field but now we have to think and get our feet back on the ground It feels like a massive step but in the table it is a small step We have to be honest they played Thursday in a very hard game and you could see after 20 minutes we had the fire and things were going to go our way It s very important in terms of momentum but we have to keep that going", "By Luke Edwards 2 00PM BST 14 Apr 2013 Comments Sunderland secured their first win under Paolo Di Canio and their first on Tyneside for 13 years to drag local rivals Newcastle United back into the relegation mix The Black Cats deserved their win They could have had a penalty in either half the most blatant when Steven Taylor had a hold of Danny Graham s shirt and were a constant threat whenever Adam Johnson or Stephane Sessegnon got the ball and ran at a ponderous Newcastle defence Sessegnon opened the scoring in the first half and after a sustained period of home pressure Johnson got the second cutting inside from the right before finding the far corner with a shot that gave substitute goalkeeper Rob Elliot no chance Having put so much into their failed attempt to beat Benfica in the Europa League on Thursday night Newcastle were always going to be a little weary and so it proved Sunderland were sharper and brighter in almost every area of the pitch and took the lead with just under half an hour played when Jonas Gutierrez gave the ball away to Seb Larsson The Swede merely moved it on to Sessegnon who ran at Steven Taylor made room for a shot and guided it into the bottom corner from 22 yards Fans arrested following Tyne Wear derby Newcastle United v Sunderland as it happened Premier League table Premier League live scores Di Canio s daughters targets of abuse Ben Arfa vows to stay at Newcastle It was the not the most powerful shot but its placement was perfect clipping the inside of the post although goalkeeper Tim Krul was perhaps caught a little flat footed The goal took the fizz out of Newcastle s support although the Magpies enjoyed the their best five minutes after going behind Papiss Demba Cisse denied by a superb save from Simon Mignolet as he dashed off his line before making a low save at full stretch to keep out the same player At the other end Danny Graham a Newcastle fan was causing problems for his marker Mapou Yanga Mbiwa with his back to goal and could have scored a second for the Black Cats but his shot on the turn was weak Sunderland had even better opportunity to extend their lead before the break when Carlos Cuellar put a free header from a Seb Larsson corner straight at Krul In stoppage time at the end of the half a miss hit cross from Gutierrez almost made a amends for his earlier blunder but Mignolet managed to turn it round the post Newcastle flew at their neighbours like an angry cat looking to scratch out the eyes of a rival They had the ball in the net in that period Papiss Cisse smashing home a flick from Moussa Sissoko only for it be wrongly ruled out by an offside flag Hatem Ben Arfa also missed a great chance with a close range header but then came Johnson s strike on the break Still Newcastle believed they could get back into it but when Sessegnon left the woeful Cheick Tiote for dead he fed David Vaughan who smashed a rising shot into the top corner to spark bedlam in the away dugout and despair among the home fans", "London Welsh s majority shareholder Kelvin Byron has confirmed that he will pull out his financial support at the end of the season Byron who helped save the club from liquidation in 2009 slammed the Rugby Football Union and Premier Rugby for not giving the club enough funding during their first campaign in the Premiership and then hitting them with a five point deduction for fielding an ineligible player in Tyson Keats He also questioned what was the point in continuing to support the club when there s hardly a Welshman in the side I m pulling out that s absolutely definite and I ve had enough of the RFU and PRL Byron told The Rugby Paper I ve had 20 years with London Welsh one of the great rugby brands but everything s been done to get us back out of the division I ve done a hell of a lot for rugby but there s hardly a Welshman in the side so what s the point The bottom line is the RFU and PRL don t want us there and if that s the situation London Welsh will have to find a level they can play at I won t be involved in rugby after the end of this season anywhere in the UK If they get new investors on the board maybe they can take it back to the Premiership But what is the point when the funding is so inadequate", "By Nick Pearce 1

Curtis Priday emails with this I think Stoke s style of play is a lot more complex than the one dimensional route one label that has be bestowed upon them They usually have a sturdy defence although this is not been the case recently They are notoriously hard to break down strong and have some technically gifted players Manager Tony Pulis has them tactically drilled so that they make it difficult for team to come up against Many people moan and complain that Stoke play boring football and simply make themselves hard to beat but I would like for them to consider this When we compare the BPL with other leagues La Liga and Bundesliga we tend to argue that there is never an easy game in our league whereas the Spanish and German giants face very little resistance in their marches to the

seems Van Persie Manchester United s prolific talisman during the first half of this season will face Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium having gone 685 minutes without a goal for the Premier League leaders That pales in comparison to Birtles who managed just one in his first 32 games for United after his big money arrival from Nottingham Forest in 1980 and he admits the distraction of his failure to score almost killed him It all reached a head when I almost killed myself when driving back to Nottingham from Manchester after a game against Everton My barren run was running through my mind I wasn t concentrating on my driving and I ended up skidding across the road Luckily for me I spun into a farmer s yard through an open gate but it was a road used by articulated lorries and had

there pal He stays at 2 Snedeker has a similar conversation with his ball at the fourth and the American drops his first shot in nearly two days to move back to 7 20 26 Never write off anybody at the Masters but there are a few challenges starting to peter away Leishman might be one of those with a bogey at four his putt for par far too short Thorbjorn Olesen who is suffering from whiplash is remarkably 3 for the week with a storming back nine four birdies and just the single bogey seems him turn in 33 20 22 Shot gone for Woods at five is that the Masters gone for this year too He s now six behind with holes running out steadily Westwood starts to make a nation believe if only for an hour or so as he holes a putt at the seventh to go four under par four off the lead Scott holds the fourth to stick at six under 20 17 After the fireworks of the first two holes Day does well to keep pars at three and four He s back to the steady solid play we saw yesterday Cabrera goes short with his birdie attempt at three and remains 8 Langer has a really tough putt from the edge of the green once more for par but fails to find it from about 20 feet he drops back to 3 and his blistering start has hit the speedbump 20 15 Nerves from Scott They might have just fluttered away scattered like confetti in the Georgian air It s a big attempt for birdie at three about 15 feet away but it s nailed He s back up to 6 two off the lead A little tidbit from a bit further along the course much like Na previously Bubba struggles at the 12th and shoots a seven over 10 20 13 Cabrera joins the leaders once more with a birdie at the second the Argentine could have even made eagle but he ll settle for 8 along with Snedeker and Day These three are just giving a little glance over their shoulders and wondering if they will put the turbo on Langer s putting finally fails him at six his par attempt at the fringe not Edinburgh refuses to drop He s back to four under par 20 08 Tiger has started pretty quietly with three pars through three A chance for birdie at four wide He taps his cap but is still fairly annoyed at his slow but steady start Earlier he was having the time of his life riding this invisible micropig 20 03 Leishman and Scott make par that will loosen them a little especially Scott It s been said a lot from people that Scott winning would be nice karma but karma doesn t keep your hand steady and your head even steadier 19 59 Rain begins to fall Splish splash splosh it goes as Westwood sees a putt for birdie break right he stays on 3 through five Scott s birdie effort is weak as a malnourished contortionist and he ll have a tough putt for par Leishman his two ball partner is deep in the bunker but plays it out well Another spot on putt from Langer keeps him on 5 along with the aforementioned duo from down under 19 57 Are nerves getting the better of Scott here A dropped shot at the first and a very very tentative play along the second his third shot rests on the longer stuff on the edge of the green It will be a two putt for par 19 53 Pull up a chair Snedeker the view is lovely in the lead He joins Day within seconds with a birdie at the first The Sned hasn t dropped a shot here since the ninth on Friday phenomenal and the reason he s favourite going into today 19 49 Woops and hollers all over the second Day is in the lead It s an eagle at the second Sensational chip out of the bunker sees him go birdie eagle cancelling out those final two holes yesterday and then some He s eight under par This has started in a whirlwind fashion Clark gets his dropped shot back at two to go 3 once more It s all happening here 19 47 Langer has ice in his veins Nothing to do with today that statistic just a little known fact about him It helps with his putting he s got a toughie to save par at four from 10 feet and makes it So too Westwood who has his putting in form for now 19 45 Well held Rose The lengthy putts to make birdies and pars are getting holed and there s cheers swirling around No such luck for Scott the Aussie drops one at the first with his eight footer breaking a little too right He s down to 5 19 39 Rose is in the bunker at seven but his approach shot isn t too hot and he ll struggle to stay level par Snedeker and Cabrera about to tee off will one of these be the Masters champion as they walk onto the 18th green Snedeker is in a dashing pink number very smart Cabrera is in a white shirt a bit too big for him and looks ready to hit the dancefloor 19 35 Masters Sunday has arrived Day birdies the first to move to 6 with yet another one putt he was a machine until the final two holes yesterday which brought him bogey woe He s now at 6 one off the lead Big cheer at the third for the luminous Langer he s gone birdie birdie birdie after another smart mid length putt to go within two of the lead He might look like a gym instructor that s had one too many cocktails at the bar but he s golfing royalty and he s charging up the leaderboard 19 32 Tiger is in the trees at the second and he punches his way out without issue Westwood is on the edge of the green at the third and chips it within three feet of the hole should be a par but with Westy s putting there s no guarantees 19 29 Some really good golf getting played here at the early stages but not so much for Clark who bogeys the first after an erratic approach onto the tee left him with a little too much to do He s down to 2 Rickie Fowler straps himself into the rollercoaster for the final time he s 1 through one and one under for the week 19 24 Birdie for Langer He s up to 4 just three off the leader Westwood makes birdie as well to move to 3 A bit further down the course Schwartzel nearly holes one of the most incredible putts you ll see He is standing vertical to the ninth hole but knocks it at a 90 degree angle to his right It rolls around and around but just misses It s all gone a bit crazy golf out there Incredible example of what these greens can do 19 21 Langer is looking in good nick already though not hard to do so wearing a snazzy orange number His massive eagle put from somewhere in Canada is just short but that should be two birdies over the first two holes for him Woods birdie opportunity drifts short as well par at the first 19 14 Played Mr Couples He holes a birdie at six from the edge of the green to move back to level par McIlroy finishes his week with his best round 69 but ends it 2 overall 19 13 Tim Clark at the first tee polite applause good drive Woods in red rapturous applause drives it near the trees Go figure Love him hate him there s few better sights in sport than Tiger in red He s never come from behind on the last day to win a major however Keep that in mind before you get all giggly and excited 19 09 Weather watch from The Telegraph s James Corrigan There s a storm heading towards Augusta A real one Nothing to do with Tiger or a 14 year old or a drop or a clock There s probably one brewing at 13 too Na has just smashed his second shot into the creek Time to go home pal 19 06 Oooof first little move at the leaders from Bernhard Langer perhaps The 55 year old has a pretty tough downhill putt for birdie from 15 feet on greens far from kind but drains it front and centre to move to 3 19 00 Kevin Na is great entertainment A bit loopy but good fun He talks to his ball as he was arguing with his wife around Ikea He finds the water off the tee three times at the 12th He will be getting horrible flashbacks to this moment in 2011 at the Valero Texas Open when took 16 shots Here at Augusta he flashes a wry smile as he putts for 10 seven over par He goes 16 Not that it will really matter to him They re all just numbers now 18 55 McIlroy decked in grey how relevant of him bags a birdie at 16 to go three under for the round and 2 overall David Lynn leader at some point way back on Thursday bogeys 17 to go to 5 for the week level par today 18 52 If a picture could tell a thousand words it would probably be a bit more interesting than this However it does give some indication of the week champion Bubba has had his erratic driving proving his downfall He s level through eight today and 2 overall Hope he s been practising his dressing technique for the winner later 18 50 Jonathan Liew has kept us busy all week with his view from Augusta a big thank you to him Here s his latest on the final day Sandy Lyle in chipper mood after posting a 71 his best round of the week It s been an encouraging partial return to form for him and there were a few glimpses of the old magic out there his birdie putt at the 1st his superb chips at 13 14 15 and 18 his sublime tee shot to the 16th feeding back down the slope and rolling to 2ft Still he finishes on 9 for the tournament Back to the old farts next week he muttered as he strode back into the clubhouse 18 46 Hello England s Rose Justin Rose that is He s out on course pars the first and birdies the second big effort needed for him to do anything of note today He s back under par at 1 Charl Schwartzel the man I put my week s wages on to win this tournament birdies five to give me a slight twinge Alas he s on level par for the week and the 2011 champion will not feature in the final shake up 18 39 Haas is not quite on fire but he s sparking a little two birdies through three puts him on 1 It would be a mammoth effort from him or anyone that far behind to be in amongst the final standings He s giving it a good go however so too good old Gonzalo Fernandez Castano who birdies the first and goes two under 18 34 Continuing the theme of cuddly golfers Phil Mickelson shoots a 73 in a weekend that never got going Rarely will you see big Phil go no lower than 71 at Augusta He ends nine over par 18 25 Lyle will cuddle a 71 in the clubhouse and a score of 9 for the week He s definitely a cuddler Sandy His four days read 73 72 81 71 Spot the bum round Guan finishes the day three over and 12 overall The golfing world shall anticipate his return next year when he ll be 15 yes 15 and probably at the goth emo stage of adolescence 18 20 Ishikawa doing his best to re enact the flamingo scene in Alice In Wonderland there He s on 4 for the day through 16 though that still isn t the best score out there right now Michael Thompson surprise winner of the Honda Classic earlier in the year has picked up four birdies on the back nine to go five under through 16 The American still remains on 2 overall however Curiouser and curiouser 18 15 Freddie Freddie Freddie The sleep hasn t had much effect on Couples it appears he drops a shot at the first to move to 1 Much like Sergio Garcia the thought of him winning was nice while it lasted but the deadening blow of reality knocks us all cold 18 09 Couple of early movers up the leaderboard Birdies galore for Watson KJ Choi Bill Haas Freddie Jacobson and John Huh the only player on tour whose name can be translated as yer wha early doors Jason Dufner looked to be mounting a bit of a challenge at one point yesterday namely at the eighth when he went five under par but he s now 2 after a double bogey at the first He ll look even sadder than usual 17 58 Lyle nabs that birdie on 16 to go 8 for the week as does Guan to move back up to 11 Fred Couples bang in the mix until dropping four shots on the final five holes is teeing off

the items his caddy bag a projector screen a snooker table and a wall Back to the drawing board What doesn t kill you makes you stronger I will be stronger 17 43 Guan might be one of the stories of the week but his two ball partner Sandy Lyle deserves a little nod of acknowledgement The 1988 Masters champion missed the cut in his previous three Augusta appearances but he s enjoyed a decent week

on though The first hole looks to be a bit tricky today only four birdies so far and a fair few bogeys It will be interesting how those mingling at two under par set out attack it from the off or gently ease into the round Tactics on Masters Sunday play a big part aside from last year of course when Bubba Watson boomed his way around in frantic style 16 47 Players are already out on the course

only to the final Sunday before school is out for summer Speaking of summer the weather looks pretty good at the moment a little bit cloudy and there is a chance of rain later when some of the big boys get going What a day in prospect People flock around television screens to see who will be adorned in one of the most iconic prizes in sport while those not into golf wonder what all the fuss is about Out there somewhere is a narrative waiting to be written Is this the time of Angel Cabrera the 2009 champion who has appeared from nowhere well Argentina to share the lead with his son as caddy Is this the moment Australia finally has a Masters champion Is it written for Adam Scott to finally banish that evil final day of Lytham or could one of the less fancied ones Jason Day or Marc Leishman be flying that flag Is the name of Tiger Woods going to be etched even deeper into history in a week of hang wringing and hullabaloo Or perhaps it is the man below Brandt Snedeker one of the most popular exciting players on tour to pick up his first major just weeks after he was written off through injury Augusta is an 18 hole tapestry waiting to be woven upon Grab a needle We re on the march Join us Essential reading from today s Telegraph Sport Paul Hayward Tiger put between a drop and a hard place James Corrigan Woods facing player backlash at Augusta Jonathan Liew Guan given tough lesson in art of scapegoating", "By Paul Bolton at Welford Road 7 37PM BST 14 Apr 2013 Comments Leicester strolled into the Premiership play offs with a win that was as comfortable as it was predictable against an underpowered Wasps Two tries from England scrum half Ben Youngs the second which clinched the bonus point just four minutes into the second half secured Leicester s top four place One win in their last two league games will guarantee a home semi final This game lacked the intensity that Leicester can expect to encounter in the play offs because Wasps sent up a severely depleted squad and never threatened to win at Welford Road for the first time since September 2008 Wasps were more competitive than their previous visit in January when they were trounced 34 8 but they played their best rugby in the final quarter when Leicester had built up a 35 9 lead and lost some of their shape by making a raft of substitutions It was a half decent performance and I was happy with the first 45 minutes or so said Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill Saracens 47 Worcester 17 London Welsh 14 Northampton 31 Championship round up There was a danger after the last couple of weeks that we could be a bit flat but it was job done five points we guaranteed ourselves top four spot and another win will give us a home semi so we are exactly where we want to be We were a little bit low key this week we only trained twice Wednesday and Friday morning and freshened everybody up because there was no point being on the training field for too long There are bit to improve on and we know that when the crunch time comes the players can raise that intensity It would have been easy for Wasps to use their depleted side as an excuse for their second heavy defeat at Welford Road this season following a 34 8 reverse in the LV Cup in January But Dai Young the Wasps director of rugby admitted that his side failed to cope with Leicester s physicality It was a disappointing first half we could not handle the physicality that Leicester brought to the game They got front foot ball far too easily and got over the gainline far too easily and if you are going to give them that sort of ball you are going to struggle Young said We fell off far too many tackles in the first half and the physicality and tempo with which Tigers played the game we simply could not live with Two months ago Wasps were competing for a play off place themselves but they have now lost their last six games in all competitions three to top four sides and will probably need to beat Exeter and Sale in their last two matches if they are to qualify for next season s Heineken Cup The loss of fly half Nick Robinson shoulder and wing Christian Wade elbow with injuries in the first half added to Young s selection headaches It looked like they picked a side not to win to be fair to them They rested most of their key guys apart from half a dozen or so so you have to take that into the context of the result Cockerill said Had Toby Flood not missed four of his first six kicks and goal and fumbled when the Wasps defence was stretched Leicester s margin of victory would have been even more emphatic Flood finally mastered a tricky wind by nudging Leicester ahead with penalties in the first quarter and relentless pressure brought Youngs s first try from close range and a well worked effort from lock Graham Kitchener Leicester decided not to risk England trio Geoff Parling shoulder Tom Youngs ankle and Tom Croft back after they sustained minor injuries in Toulon last week but Leicester have the strength in depth that Wasps lack Rob Hawkins capped an outstanding display at hooker by rumbling over just before half time and Ben Youngs nipped in for his second soon after the break Adam Thompstone s 59th minute try and Flood s conversion proved to be Leicester s last scores and Wasps had the slight satisfaction of scoring the best try of the match which Elliot Daly conjured from nothing with a brilliant individual break", "Before an Anfield memorial service to mark the 24th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster on Monday victims families have renewed calls for those responsible for the establishment cover up that followed to be made fully and swiftly accountable The annual service in remembrance of the 96 people who died in the disaster on 15 April 1989 at an FA Cup semi final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest is the first since the Hillsborough Independent Panel definitively demonstrated that the causes were the unsafe ground and the inadequate response of the emergency services After a three year review of more than 450 000 pieces of evidence it also revealed for the first time the scale of the establishment cover up that swung into action immediately after the disaster to deflect blame from the police and smear Liverpool fans In the wake of the panel s report the original verdicts of accidental death have been quashed and a new inquest ordered The Independent Police Complaints Commission is also conducting a wide ranging inquiry into police culpability and malpractice which could take up to two years and the former Durham police chief Jon Stoddart is re examining the case for new criminal charges But Jenni Hicks the mother of Sarah and Victoria Hicks who were 15 and 19 respectively when they were killed at Hillsborough said that if the families were forced to fight for accountability it would be a third national disgrace to follow what the prime minister David Cameron called the double injustice of the disaster and the cover up The first national disgrace was that 96 people died at a football match The second was the lies and the cover up The third will be if they make the families fight for the accountability We re still working towards the inquests which I would think will be the next stage of the journey said Hicks speaking in a programme to be aired this week on Liverpool FC s television channel Hopefully the correct verdict will be put in place which for me will be that those 96 people were all unlawfully killed This campaign isn t about vengeance it never has been It s about putting something very wrong right It s basically about enduring and unconditional love for our loved ones A pre inquest hearing will be held on 25 April in London where a coroner is expected to set out the terms and scope of the new inquest The independent panel s report raised grave concerns over the 3 15pm cut off time imposed in the original inquest by Dr Stefan Popper which led to the mistaken belief that an effective emergency services intervention could not have saved lives The report revealed that 41 of the victims might have been saved had the emergency response been better It also found that 116 of the 164 police statements doctored afterwards were changed to show the police in a better light and that the South Yorkshire ambulance service had also altered statements to deflect criticism A new memorial sculpture the first in Liverpool city centre is being unveiled on Sunday and Monday s memorial service at Anfield will include the lighting of candles for each of the 96 victims and a minute s silence at 3 06pm the time the match was abandoned Brian Benson whose son David was 22 when he died said the families also wanted others shown by the report to bear responsibility including the Football Association and Hillsborough s owners Sheffield Wednesday FC to be held accountable I feel very strongly we all do that the FA should be accountable that the former West Yorkshire police chief constable Norman Bettison should be accountable and stripped of his knighthood and he should not have been allowed to retire that was the biggest cover up The Sheffield Wednesday football ground for having no safety certificate and also the ambulance service for not being able to cope he said Live coverage of the Hillsborough memorial service will be broadcast from 2 15pm on LFC TV on Monday watch free on Sky Channel 429 Virgin Channel 544", "By Henry Winter at Wembley Stadium 6 00PM BST 14 Apr 2013 Comments Manchester City reached the FA Cup final against Wigan Athletic on May 11 but they needed to withstand a spirited response from Chelsea who refused to let the Cup leave their grasp without a real fight City were in control leading through Samir Nasri and Sergio Aguero when Chelsea suddenly started playing pulling a goal back through Demba Ba but City held on Just It would have been cruel on Yaya Toure in particular if City had not progressed The midfielder was again immense charging from end to end a powerful blend of physique and touch almost unplayable at times contributing fully to a magnificent Cup tie A superb game acquired controversial elements in the second half Aguero should have been sent off for a two footed challenge on David Luiz Fernando Torres then raked Aguero while the Spanish striker was unfortunate not to win a penalty after being impeded by Vincent Kompany Led out by Kompany City had settled the quicker and it took Chelsea more than an hour to show Until then City controlled the game Chelsea v Man City ratings Chelsea v Man City as it happened Malaga coach Pellegrini a target for Chelsea Cup win unlikely to save Benitez From the opening minutes Toure charged away from Eden Hazard who struggled to cling to his coat tails Aguero hit the side netting Attacks were coming from all angles Gael Clichy scampered through the middle Nasri made a sparkling dribble into the box Aguero flicked on a Toure shot forcing Petr Cech into a save against the post Cech then pushed away a Carlos T vez shot following a long intricate move by City For an hour Chelsea s counters were intermittent Kompany shepherded the ball away from Ba John Obi Mikel overhit a pass to Ba Matija Nastasic ran across to close down Ba Oscar showing his quick feet nutmegged Pablo Zabaleta and was brought down Yet they woke up briefly midway through the half finding their belief Oscar Juan Mata and Hazard stepped up a gear and Ba s runs began to be more productive After 22 minutes Kompany was penalised for a push on Ba out on Chelsea s right Mata lifted in the free kick City scrambled the ball out but Hazard met the clearance striking it down into the ground over a line of players including the huge keeper Costel Pantilimon but Kompany was well placed on the line Chelsea raced upfield again Ramires crudely stopped by Barry but they were caught out by another reminder of Toure s class after 35 minutes He stormed down the right cutting in and playing the ball through to Aguero The Argentine laid the ball off to Nasri who got a fortunate bounce off Cesar Azpilicueta and stroked the ball past Cech Chelsea responded Oscar was switching flanks in an attempt to find a way through Appearing on the left the Brazilian touched the ball across to Mata whose left footed shot caused Pantilimon to throw himself into a huge stretching attempt to reach the ball but it was going way wide Pantilimon s presence was a surprise replacing Joe Hart but he had little to do for an hour The focus remained on Cech s area as the second half opened City were late to re emerge from the dressing room although Roberto Mancini was out early signing autographs as he waited for his players Their timing was soon operating like clockwork again James Milner working the right slipped the ball back to Barry who dinked in a cross Chelsea froze Cech was rooted to his line Branislav Ivanovic had failed to stick with Aguero who looped a header over Cech and in Chelsea briefly looked tired their heavy schedule now amounting to 59 games seeming to have caught up with them Until the hour mark they kept being hustled out of possession by City Toure nicked the ball off Mata who ran back to rescue the situation with an interception off T vez Zabaleta then took the ball effortlessly off Oscar Clichy added to Azpilicueta s woes with a neat intervention Oscar Hazard and Ramires had chances but nothing was going right for Chelsea until Rafa Ben tez made an important move calling for Torres after 64 minutes Chelsea s interim first team coach could have removed Ba keeping the 4 2 3 1 system but instead he went 4 4 2 and was immediately rewarded Luiz swept a long ball forward and Ba exploiting rare uncertainty in City s defence hooked Chelsea back into the game Chelsea were transformed Gone were all the thoughts about heavy legs and that intense schedule Hazard played the ball into the box Nastasic stretched out a foot but Mata was through Pantilimon ran out and dived at Mata s feet getting the ball but also catching the Spaniard Chris Foy waved play on Chelsea believed the tide was turning Ba turned nimbly in the box but Pantilimon saved well Mancini made a change after 73 minutes a cautious change removing T vez for Javi Garcia with Toure pushing on City s fans tried to rally their team chanting Come on City come on City as Chelsea continued to attack One Hazard run was crudely ended by Kompany Luiz s free kick whistled wide City had a rare break but Toure had his heel clipped when shooting The game then turned ugly Luiz was holding off Aguero aggressively but nothing could condone the Argentine s reaction jumping two footed into the Brazilian Somehow Aguero escaped punishment despite the referee Chris Foy being close by Some retribution was exacted by Luiz s friend Torres who raked Aguero s Achilles Torres almost inflicted more pain Running on to Mata s pass with four minutes remaining he clearly had his shirt pulled by Kompany impeding his path to goal Foy ignored the offence The fourth official Kevin Friend signalled four minutes of added time In the first Toure and Aguero almost calmed City s nerves with a breakaway Still Chelsea believed Ryan Bertrand delivered in a cross from the left but Pantilimon claimed it It was breathless stuff classic cup fare Into the third minute Hazard drove through but his shot was poor surprisingly for such a fine technical player Shortly after Foy blew the final whistle and City were through to the final", "Six days to go until the London Marathon and how different it all feels this year Twelve months ago my overriding emotion was fear of not finishing of letting people down of the unknown This time round my biggest worry is complacency My training has gone well Last year s ankle injury hasn t flared up I know I can finish But if I start too fast and then hit a wall at mile 16 To be honest I didn t expect to be doing the London Marathon ever again I really enjoyed last year The crowd was fabulous But it was hard And my knee ankle problems were sufficiently bad that I did not run for six months afterwards But time is a great healer The difficult memories fade So when last autumn the two charities I ran for last year Whizz Kidz and Action for Stammering Children asked me to run again I thought What the heck Actually I thought Five hours 31 minutes I can do better than that Nothing like a bit of competitive edge to spur you on And once my shadow cabinet colleague Jim Murphy said in an interview that he could beat my time carrying Ed Balls on my back well the die was cast Of course I know Jim will go quicker than me He s a bit younger and much lighter and probably fitter too As are tens of thousands of others who will go much faster then me too That s the great thing about the marathon it really is the taking part that counts What other sporting event allows world class elite athletes to compete in the same event as middle aged punters like me The power of the London Marathon was brought home last week when we gathered on the green in Westminster to launch my fundraising drive I was joined by some of the children and young peoplewho have been supported by both charities and a group of other runners putting themselves through the pain for these great causes And to my great surprise one of those also running for Whizz Kidz is marathon veteran Iva Barr aged 85 Think about that 85 years old and she will be on the starting line on Sunday to run and walk more than 26 miles for charity Iva is one person who I should really beat in terms of finishing time But her achievement and commitment will make anything I can do look small in comparison To sponsor Ed s

remain unconcerned On the final climb of Cauberg I just looked down and pedalled without thinking so much Kreuziger said afterwards It was a special race When I went we didn t know what would happen if we d stay away In the last kilometre they told me I had 15 seconds at the start of the Cauberg and that was when I started to think I could win The Cauberg was never ending As the Czech closed in on the biggest one day win of his career the peloton almost caught Gilbert s group before the Belgian missed out on a podium place when he was outsprinted by Valverde who took second spot and Gerrans

minutes to edge Manchester United ever closer towards securing their 20th domestic title Van Persie ran half the length of the pitch to celebrate with manager Sir Alex Ferguson after ending his 12 hour drought from the spot as Stoke City s relegation fears increased United now only require seven points from their final six games after moving even further clear of Manchester City in another resounding victory at the Britannia Stadium Tony Pulis has suffered a slump that Roberto Mancini can only dream about happening to United and they have only one win from 14 league games and are perched perilously above the relegation zone Saturday s trip to seemingly doomed QPR has now taken on monumental proportions for Pulis as Stoke bid to ensure they have two dates with United to look forward to next season Stoke City v Manchester United as it happened Premier League action in pictures Premier League table Premier League fixtures But any lingering hopes Mancini may have had over an astonishing collapse for City s bitter neighbours were extinguished here in a performance that was at times a stroll Stoke had lost eight of their previous nine encounters with Ferguson and were behind after just four minutes Defending set pieces has been one of Stoke s renowned strengths but even that art has deserted Pulis s team as their season has unravelled Van Persie s corner was not sufficiently cleared after Phil Jones s attempted acrobatics and Carrick capitalised on the hesitancy to stab the ball into the corner Wayne Rooney then tested Asmir Begovic from distance as United were allowed an embarrassing amount of time and space to dictate the play in midfield These are indeed worrying times for Pulis who has never been relegated as a manager and it seems light years ago that the Britannia Stadium was considered one of the most inhospitable venues in the country On current form it resembles more of a flimsy wendy house than a fortress Stoke finally displayed some of their trademark defiance and intensity midway through the half and Robert Huth headed over from a Glenn Whelan free kick but David de Gea who was highlighted as United s weakness here last season was untroubled While Stoke s shortage of goals remains alarming van Persie s own drought had been a mystery and he could have scored early in the second half when he was released in the box by Javier Hernandez s exquisite cross field pass but he drove his shot into the side netting But just when Stoke appeared to establishing a foothold United sucked the life out of them by extending their lead in the 66th minute Rooney found van Persie in the box and he was upended by Andy Wilkinson before quickly getting up to slot home the penalty Though Ferguson has insisted the 22 million signing s lack of recent goals was not an issue van Persie clearly enjoyed the moment running all the way to the dug out to give Ferguson a bear hug Normal service has been resumed Match details Stoke 4 5 1 Begovic

whatever team his finger did land that would be the one his side would pounce on to try get over from their derby defeat he d probably be hoping that digit would dial up Stoke The devilish Reds must be one of the few teams that literally like you know like literally enjoy playing Stoke since Sir Alex Ferguson s team have won eight and lost none of nine previous league larks against the Potters And besides all that Stoke are going down quicker than a cold beer on a hot spring day Deary me Stoke what have you done to yourselves Your mean stare and physical strut used to scare the living daylights out of some of the Premier League s more prissy pups Sometimes it felt like all you had to do was show up exude your masculinity and the points were yours for the taking Beautiful it never was but effective it has been And after the draw with Southampton before the new year opened its eyes you were kicking it in an awesome eighth spot with 29 points on the board seven points off a Champions League spot It was the best position you d been in at that point in the season since your return to hanging with the big boys But ever since then a rot has taken hold and 100 odd days later it ain t letting go That period has seen you undertake 11 league games and be taken under eight times It has also seen you slide to a tremulous three points above the relegation zone Now people can come up with statistics to prove anything 14 of people know that but they do indicate that a collective dip in form from your backline boys is not helping your cause Before that Saints sojourn you had played 21 and conceded 20 after it you d played 12 yet you d conceded 22 Then again Peter Crouch Kenwyne Jones Michael Owen Cameron Jerome and Jonathan Walters not covered themselves in goal scoring glory have they The five of them have four league goals between them all year and your team has failed to score in 7 of your last 12 games Tony Pulis don t rotate much either it s a smallish squad under his command and you tend to concede late goals too so perhaps you are plain old tired and in need of a good old break But while fans chew on their nails about Manchester United s impending arrival Crouch is keeping his cuticles suitable Look at his fingers Look closely now There is not an speck of nail bearing teeth marks is there He ain t worried no how When the bigger sides come here we have normally performed really well and given them a tough tough afternoon he said with a nonchalant flick of his tongue We have arguably produced our best football this season against the top five

police in ugly scenes that cast a further shadow over English football after an outbreak of serious violence between Millwall fans at Wembley After an intense north east derby at St James Park between Newcastle United and Sunderland on Sunday afternoon which Newcastle lost 3 0 supporters threw glass bottles firecrackers bricks and rocks at police with one officer reportedly saying This is the worst rioting I have seen in the city centre in decades One Newcastle fan was seen to punch a police horse and wheelie bins were set alight as supporters rampaged through the streets The most serious incident occurred when a group of Newcastle supporters tried to confront their Sunderland counterparts at the city s Central station During the fracas three officers were injured and one required hospital treatment The Northumbria police chief superintendent Steve Neill said Disappointingly there was some disorder involving what appear to be Newcastle United supporters following the match in the city centre including an incident at Central station Disruptive behaviour of any kind is not tolerated Inquiries will take place into these incidents and action will be taken against all those involved Public safety is always our number one priority during any football match For those who chose to get involved in disruptive behaviour they were either dealt with swiftly by officers or will be subject to retrospective action at a later date The violence came despite the authorities warning fans ahead of the match to be on their best behaviour realising the potentially volatile nature of the fixture Newcastle and Sunderland are fierce local rivals and the result Sunderland s first win at the stadium in 13 years appears to have sparked the trouble Police also warned supporters in the build up to the match to refrain from political gestures that might incite hostility as the new Sunderland manager Paolo di Canio has previously declared his fascist beliefs Hooliganism has been reduced at football matches in recent years but ugly clashes at Wembley on Saturday as well as Sunday s trouble on Tyneside were a stark reminder that the problem has not been eradicated Millwall fans

of the good work we have done to try and change the perception of the club We are trying to find the answers to what happened Of the 14 arrests at Wembey 12 of which were Millwall fans four were for affray one for affray and possession of class A drugs one for affray and assault on police two for public order offences one for assault causing actual bodily harm and possession of class A drugs one for a racially aggravated public order offence one for ticket touting one for possession of class A drugs one for theft and possession of an offensive weapon and one for breach of a banning order A

secured a home semi final in the Premiership play offs The Worcester centre Josh Matavesi made the challenge on De Kock that prompted an incensed McCall to remonstrate with his Worcester counterpart Richard Hill De Kock was led from the field but soon returned though he was taken off at half time It was a horrendous challenge we could have lost our scrum half with a broken jaw or cheekbone said McCall Fortunately he seems to be OK but it looked pretty deliberate to me I leapt up as I felt it could have been a deliberate game ploy from Worcester Hill who accepted that the tackle was bad said It was a very clumsy challenge from Josh but he s not a malicious player It was badly mistimed and a citing seems likely Josh has apologised and I fully understand Mark s reaction to protect his player Saracens were able to record a convincing win that secured their home semi final spot despite resting a number of key players Owen Farrell Schalk Brits Steve Borthwick and Ernst Joubert were given a break but Jacques Burger made a welcome return after an 18 month absence following knee surgery McCall said It showed the depth of our squad as we backed up well after a testing European quarter final at Twickenham We took our chances David Strettle s second try was as good a finish as you will see but though we are happy with the win we played well below our standard Worcester continued their disastrous away record in the Premiership and could not recover from being 23 3 down after only 25 minutes Strettle was the star performer scoring a hat trick of tries in that time The opening one had come from Saracens first attack John Smit softened up the visitors defence with a couple of bursts before the ball was transferred sweetly along the line for Strettle to force his way over in the corner That was followed by a brilliant solo effort from the wing From halfway he spotted a gap in the Worcester defence raced away and easily evaded the Warriors full back Chris Pennell for a try which Charlie Hodgson converted When Strettle got his third try a simple run in a huge victory looked likely for Saracens But Worcester without an away league win this season showed some spirit to contest the remainder of the match A strong run from Alex Grove created a try for Josh Drauniniu that was converted by Gray and after the interval Saracens conceded a second try Drauniniu and David Lemi combined cleverly to take Worcester deep into the home 22 and from the resulting lineout Matt Kvesic was driven over for a try that Gray converted Saracens stunned by the reverse resumed control with a driving lineout try of their own with Carlos Nieto the scorer Charlie Hodgson converted and added his third penalty of the afternoon before late tries from Chris Ashton and Jackson Wray both converted by Hodgson ensured that the final score line was an accurate reflection of the game Not that Hill saw it that way We had a very poor slow start but got our second wind just

where both teams swapped the lead Celtic midfielder Kris Commons and United skipper Jon Daly grabbed doubles with goals from Tannadice winger Gary Mackay Steven and Victor Wanyama ensuring extra time However in the 104th minute Stokes on for Mikael Lustig in the second half headed in a James Forrest cross to ensure the Hoops will return to the national stadium at the end of the month hoping to complete a domestic double their Clydesdale Bank Premier League title all but clinched Remarkably Hampden witnessed its second 4 3 semi final in two days following Hibs injury time win over Irn Bru First Division Falkirk yesterday It was asking a lot for both sides to live up to that match but that s exactly what they did The game was less than two minutes old when Commons picked up the ball from Victor Wanyama and eased past United midfielder Marc Millar before lashing the ball in from 25 yards The Parkhead side while looking nervy at the back should have doubled their lead in the 20th minute when Emilio Izaguirre stood a cross up at the back post for fellow full back Lustig but his header from inside the six yard box hit the post and John Rankin cleared the ball to safety Celtic paid for that miss three minutes later after defender Kelvin Wilson failed to cut out a long ball handing possession to Daly The Irishman played Mackay Steven down the right channel and with the Hoops defence posted missing he played a one two with teenager Ryan Gauld before bending a shot past Celtic keeper Fraser Forster from inside the box United s second goal came when Izaguirre clumsily bundled Mackay Steven to the ground on the right touchline When defender Barry Douglas s in swinging free kick arrived at the near post Daly dipped his head amid a packed six yard box to send the ball past Forster The Taysiders joy was short lived though as just two minutes later Wanyama rose to bullet Izaguirre s cross past Cierzniak after Commons had set him free down the left United responded positively again and a good move ended with Rankin s goal bound drive blocked for a corner by Wilson a set piece which came to nothing It was end to end stuff and both sides were entitled to the round of applause they received at the interval whistle The second half began with midfielder Joe Ledley heading a cross from Forrest over the bar the Hoops winger back for the first time since March after recovering from a back complaint There was an inevitability about Celtic s next goal which came in the 59th although it was a rather strange finish by Commonsminute Izaguirre again raced up the left taking a Wanyama pass and when his cross came into the middle the Scotland international did not appear to know too much about it as it bounced off his chest and trundled over the line It was all Celtic by that point In the 63rd minute with the United defence stretched again stopper Sean Dillon cleared Commons s drive from 16 yards away from goal with Radoslaw Cierzniak beaten Celtic piled forward in numbers and in the 70th minute only good goalkeeping at his near post from the Tannadice keeper prevented Commons snatching his hat trick after he nipped in to reach Gary Hooper s cross from the right However a minute later there was even more drama at the other end when the unmarked Daly looped a header from Mackay Steven s cross over Forster and in off the post The cup final place once more was up for grabs Lustig and Wanyama departed to be replaced by Stokes and Beram Kayal the latter soon booked for a foul on Flood United withstood a late siege by Celtic Cierzniak saving from Mulgrew before Forrest s effort was blocked by Dillon Just over 10 minutes into strength sapping injury time saw Daly rattle the post with a header from a Douglas corner with substitute Michael Gardyne on for Gauld failing to convert the rebound before Cierzniak made another save this time from Forrest Georgios Samaras replaced Commons just before the teams swapped ends again but it was Stokes who made the headlines when he headed Celtic in front from a Forrest cross The second part of injury time saw United keeper Cierzniak make yet another save this time from Samaras with two minutes remaining but when the final whistle sounded the Tannadice side were left with only the consolation of playing their part in a thrilling semi final while Celtic look forward to the showpiece finale to the season", "By Mick Cleary Rugby Union Correspondent at the Kassam Stadium 5 34PM BST 14 Apr 2013 Comments The race is run and London Welsh are relegated The league table indicates that even with two games remaining they cannot retain their Premiership status and they will return from whence they came last summer to the Championship Mere stats however tell you little of the pluck and spirit that they have shown in trying to overcome the odds Even here with the die seemingly cast they gave it a rattle against Northampton but simply did not have enough firepower or poise to avert the inevitable two tries in two minutes from substitute Tom May just before the break sounding the death knell Luther Burrell s late try securing a valuable bonus point for Saints as they consolidate their place in the play offs There were rueful shakes of the head from the London Welsh players at the final whistle The adventure is over their only hope of staying up being if the promoted club fails to meet entry criteria It has been fun torrid at times though a real slog but they have maintained dignity in the face of it all London Welsh have been the runt of the Premiership litter unloved and unwanted They have been defiant and cussed but lacked deep enough resources to sustain a campaign Leicester 35 Wasps 16 Saracens 47 Worcester 17 Harlequins 23 Bath 9 Exeter Chiefs 27 London Irish 6 Sale Sharks 32 Gloucester 9 Worthiness only gets you so far London Welsh have had to battle not only out on the field but in court and committee rooms too They had to win promotion last year through legal action and fought furiously against the five points docked recently for fielding an ineligible player That episode took a lot of energy away from the club said London Welsh s admirable head coach Lyn Jones who expressed a desire to continue and for the club to stay at the Kassam It s important now that we hold our nerve Some of the players are quite tearful and we re sad that we re down It s how we get back up from the knock down But there is a lot of spirit and good at this club It s been a testing year but you just need to roll your sleeves up and get on with it It has been a fantastically positive experience London Welsh have to guard now against things unravelling There were rumours that chief executive Tony Copsey has left the club while principal backer Kelvin Bryon expressed his disenchantment in the Rugby Paper yesterday I m pulling out that s absolutely definite and I ve had enough of the RFU and PRL Premier Rugby Ltd said Bryon I ve had 20 years with London Welsh but everything has been done to get us back out of the division How could we have prospered when our funding is totally inadequate If we d had the 3 5 million like everyone else we d be flying The bottom line is that the RFU and PRL don t want us there I won t be involved in rugby after the end of this season I m quite dispirited and feel for so sorry for the boys on the field They ve put their bodies on the line punched above their weight and then suddenly five points are taken away so it leaves a very sour taste I ve just had the worst six to nine months of my life Misfortune followed London Welsh to the end with their splendid captain lock Jonathan Mills having to pull out just before kick off with a sore hip And yet in those early weeks and months they looked as if they were going to cause a real surprise They notched up four wins before Christmas and with Sale floundering there was the prospect of an upset Yet they have not won in the league since The pack is feisty and the forwards deserved the try they eventually got through no 8 Daniel Browne in the 70th minute from the base of a short range scrum Centre Sonny Parker is a handful with Gordon Ross a clever footballer at fly half Tom Arscott at the rear can lend pace to the attack It was Parker s interception and 60 metre gallop that teed up a try for wing Nick Scott on the half hour In truth though Northampton ought to have won more convincingly It was a ragged game with too many mistakes from either side If Saints had been more patient in their build up they would have the win in the bag long before Tom Wood put Burrell over with two minutes remaining to clinch the bonus points that sees Northampton five points clear of Gloucester May who had come on for George Pisi made the most of his opportunity weaving round the defence for his first try in the 37th minute then arrowing to the corner just moments later Burrell s first try six minutes into the second half effectively settled

the back along with an ultimatum to be shipped out come summer and hence we might be honoured to see nasri playing actual football says Himanshu Jiit And that ultimatum might have been sounded out for

2 City make an almighty balls up of a glorious chance to go into the break with a 2 0 lead Chelsea made a hot mess of an attacking free kick allowing City to break at speed down the left They had players flooding forward while Chelsea s were wheezing back and Milner was sent haring away after brushing Ramires aside He had three or four men to pick out in the middle but his cross was dreadful

has flown by 4 42pm BST 41 min Mata clearly thought about an impressively violent flying slash at the back of Toure s legs in the build up to that goal says Matt Dony It s a shame he s not that sort

says Mine He powered through the heart of the midfield as only Yaya Toure can charge through the heart of the middle and suddenly there was a huge gaping hole in the middle of Chelsea s defence Toure

awkward volley that bounced up and over the bodies only for Kompany to head it off the line 4 24pm BST 22 min This is a thrashing in all but the scoreline Tevez plays a one two with Zabaleta and then other with Aguero His fierce shot from the edge of the area is blocked There s an air of desperation about Chelsea s defending a the moment 4 22pm BST 20 min A straight ball down the middle from

charges away from Mikel and wins a free kick 30 yards from goal They don t wait around though and it s quickly worked to Nasri who twists and turns before seeing his shot deflected behind for a corner on the left The corner s half cleared but Barry turns it back into the area Toure prods it half heartedly goalwards and Aguero possibly standing in an offside position tries to help it past Cech who dives to his right to push it behind Excellent save 4 05pm BST 4 min City have settled well They re bossing possession and are setting about Chelsea at a brisk pace Chelsea haven t got going yet and they re on the back foot as Toure swats Hazard aside and powers through the middle before slipping a pass through to Aguero on the left He fires into the side netting from a tight angle 4 03pm BST 2

the PA system at Wembley needs to have a word with himself Instead of letting the crowd noise build organically we were instead treated to yet more tinny dirge 3 58pm BST And out they stride on to the Wembley pitch Apparently there was a huge roar from the fans as they emerged but overblown music is getting in the way of it Both sides are wearing blue tracksuit tops Chelsea s are darker 3 56pm BST

18pm BST Afternoon Everything s coming up Rafael Benitez Chelsea are in the semi finals of the Europa League a top four finish is on and they could reach their fourth FA Cup final in five years this afternoon Waddaamanager With a record like that he s bound to be a Chelsea legend in no time Or not Of course Chelsea s fans will tell you that Benitez succeeding isn t going to make them like him any more as their distaste for the former Liverpool manager is more visceral than that This one s personal But still even they would accept that it s all come together quite nicely for Chelsea in the last few weeks Heck even Fernando Torres has managed to locate the big rectangular sticky thing The problem for Chelsea might be that suddenly it looks like Manchester City have started rediscover the poise of old It s surely arrived too late to mount a last gasp bid to retain their title odds of 50 1 last time I checked but it at least means that City can perhaps go into the summer with renewed confidence Their performance at Old Trafford last Monday showed that there s no way they should have been 12 points behind Manchester United much to Roberto Mancini s frustration and they could yet end the season with the FA Cup added to their trophy cabinet They could have done with the likes of Yaya Toure Sergio Aguero and Samir Nasri deciding to start their seasons before April though Kick off 4pm Updated at 3 08pm BST", "Until the late 1970s the Square Mile was a genteel all male club dominated by pinstripe suits public school accents and a culture of long lunches Money was made at the Stock Exchange with effortless panache as a coterie of licensed dealers acted on behalf of stockbroker firms with redolent names such as Quilter and Co The Big Bang blew the ancien regime apart Within six months of Margaret Thatcher s election exchange controls were lifted and foreign capital flooded into Britain The deregulation of the Stock Exchange in 1986 was an invitation to the world s biggest beasts to enter the trading floor Traders began to send huge amounts of money fizzing around the world s financial networks The towers of Canary Wharf rose silver and immaculate from the industrial desert of the former London Docklands The capital began its journey to world financial domination The crash of five years ago cast a shadow on the free for all spirit that the Big Bang let rip But Thatcher s deregulatory push created the new internationally focused City For better and for worse it hasn t looked back At the start of this decade the financial sector was estimated to be worth 125 4bn or 9 4 in gross value to the UK economy As part of a famous television ad campaign from September 1986 an ordinary looking bloke is shown in a fictional village pub Lost in thought he almost knocks a passing postman from his bike It turns out he is preoccupied with the news that he can buy shares in British Gas After passing on the good news to the postie he adds If you see Sid tell him The age of Sid was not simply a PR myth Initially there really was a popular scramble by ordinary folk to sign up to the people s capitalism and reap the rewards Four million people applied for British Gas shares at 135p a pop with a minimum purchase of 100 Many then sold them almost immediately for a quick profit In Thatcher s second term Jaguar British Telecom BritOil and British Aerospace were also sold off Later British Steel British Airways BP water and electricity would follow Thatcher said that privatisation was a chance to give power back to the people In fact as Robert Philpot director of the Progress pressure group wrote last week Now in 2012 it s clear that the result of electricity privatisation was to take power away from the people Small British shareholders have no influence over the overwhelmingly non British owners of the firms that generate and distribute power in Britain Saatchi and Saatchi s Labour isn t working political poster apparently featuring a long dole queue made up of actors became perhaps the most famous in the nation s history British electioneering was changed for ever When Britain s first female prime minister was in her pomp northern football fans travelling to away games in London would be taunted by home supporters waving wads of 10 and 20 notes The brutal repartee of the terraces expressed a fundamental truth of the Thatcher period the north suffered the worst of the deep recession and high unemployment of the early years and it benefited least from the eventual boom of the late 1980s It would be wrong to say that Thatcher planned the decline of the north s most vital industries and sources of employment In fact northern England suffered precisely from the absence of a plan in Westminster In 1985 explaining why she believed regional planning in Britain was a non starter Thatcher said If we try to discourage development and economic growth in large parts of the south of England in the hope that it will happen in the large cities in the north we risk losing them altogether Left to its own devices the British economy rebalanced irrevocably to the south Employment in the manufacturing industry vital to the north s wellbeing slumped falling from 7 1 million in 1979 to 4 4m in 1993 Services and the booming City eventually took up much of the economic slack but the good times were happening in the south Thatcher came to power ready to take on the the National Union of Mineworkers which had humiliated her Tory predecessor Edward Heath during the 1970s The miners strike of 1984 85 allowed her to destroy the power of the NUM and institute a series of legal obstacles to industrial action which she believed had bedevilled Britain in the 70s Meanwhile the decline in Britain s manufacturing industry which Thatcher s government did little to reverse destroyed the power bases of British trades unionism High unemployment and recession critically weakened the unions bargaining power in the early to mid 1980s Since 1980 union membership in Britain has halved A backlash by the Christian right meant that Thatcher s shops bill designed to allow Sunday trading was voted down in 1986 It was her only defeat on an entire bill in the Commons But the road to deregulation for shops and pubs had begun After the second world war British politics seemed to have come to a lasting settlement on the fundamentals of running the country Both the Conservatives and Labour cherished the mixed economy balanced between public and private ownership Pragmatism was the order of the day as union leaders such as Jack Jones and Joe Gormley enjoyed beer and sandwiches at No 10 Economic policy was forged through achieving tripartite consensus between employers unions and the government of the day The winter of discontent sounded the knell for that way of doing things Thatcher arrived in power armed with the free market philosophy of Ronald Reagan s adviser Milton Friedman Managers must be allowed to manage became the mantra and a new style of politics was born The rise of the City of London and its new money focused ethos spawned its own style Designer labels came of age suited to the new aspirational spirit Actresses such as Joan Collins a Thatcher admirer in the American glamour soaps Dallas and Dynasty patented the look for would be female power dressers Shoulder pads and sharply tailored suits ruled Thatcher swore by her blue skirt suit pearls and Asprey handbag a look that was to influence powerful women from Hillary Clinton to Condoleezza Rice Among republicans in Northern Ireland Thatcher is loathed for her intransigence during the Maze prison hunger strike of 1981 which led to the death of Bobby Sands But four years later she appalled unionists by signing the Anglo Irish agreement which gave the Republic of Ireland a say in the affairs of the north paving the way for the Good Friday peace agreement of 1998 Thatcher s education secretary from 1986 89 Kenneth Baker transformed the state school system creating a proto market that is being enthusiastically embraced and developed by one of his successors Michael Gove Baker insisted that attainment levels be made public allowing a league table of schools to emerge At the same time he instructed schools to accept all applicants local or otherwise unless already full The choice agenda was born parents could in theory if not always in practice decide which school their child would go to Local authority control of education was also much reduced by the Education Act of 1988 which gave autonomy over budgets and appointments to heads and school governors Gove has deepened that autonomy with his academy programme and added the further option of free schools Thatcher had no interest in football despite occasional cringeworthy photo ops such as the pose outside No 10 with footballers Kevin Keegan and Emlyn Hughes before the 1980 European Championships But when one of the worst incidents of football hooliganism broke out at a Luton Millwall match in March 1985 she acted The Football Spectators Act was passed in 1989 controversially making ID cards compulsory for fans After the Hillsborough disaster that year in which 96 Liverpool fans died the plan was never acted upon Lord Taylor s Hillsborough inquiry recommended all seater stadiums in English grounds A revolution in who watched football and how they watched it was under way When the European Economic Community began to develop far beyond a free trade agreement Thatcher s strident opposition to anything beyond a single market became a hallmark of her premiership She inspired a generation of Eurosceptics and changed the chemistry of the Tory party In much of the nation fed on a diet of Up yours Delors style headlines and expos s of life aboard the Brussels gravy train the mood gradually shifted from one of relative indifference to antipathy towards the EU Murdoch s Sun switched from backing Labour to the Tories for the 1979 election that launched Thatcher The relationship became mutually beneficial from then on as she helped him create a power base that would be threatened only 30 years later during the hacking inquiry In the early 1980s Murdoch launched a bid for the Times Group newspapers which ordinarily would have been referred to the competition authorities given his existing media holdings Instead the deal went through on the nod after private meetings between Thatcher and Murdoch at Chequers Murdoch would later revolutionise the British media defying the print unions and moving his News International media group to Wapping in an overnight coup de theatre Thatcher backed him According to cabinet minister Norman Fowler any misgivings from colleagues or supporters would be met with the response Why are you so opposed to Rupert He is going to get us in Britain was not always a country obsessed with house prices But the Housing Act of 1980 which allowed council house tenants to buy their own homes changed the face of home ownership in Britain Many former local authority tenants paid less than 10 000 for homes that would be worth 10 times that a decade later Over the next 30 years this radical move towards a nation of home owners led to a trail of unintended consequences A prolonged boom in house prices took place along with a chronic shortage of affordable housing yet to be resolved by a series of governments and the gradual emergence of a culture of debt incurred on the presumption that the value of property would keep rising In the private sector rents soared In the first half of 1988 alone house prices rose by 30 On the back of the housing boom much of Britain mortgaged itself up to the hilt and household debt reached record levels Winning the Falklands war in 1982 transformed Thatcher s standing in the opinion polls Fighting it put the armed forces back on the centre stage for the first time since Suez The Falklands revived the prestige of soldiering as huge crowds gathered to wave off and welcome home the troops in Portsmouth Later came the Gulf Kosovo Afghanistan and Iraq and the tributes to the fallen at Wootton Bassett No one talks about abolishing private schools any more Unilateral nuclear disarmament is not embraced by any of the three main political parties In 1979 as Thatcher took power the top rate of income tax was 83 The ferocious battle this year over lowering the top rate of tax from 50 to 45 illustrates how far the debate on tax has shifted Losing three times to Thatcher led directly to the creation of New Labour and the emergence of Tony Blair as a leader who embraced her emphasis on choice competition and an expanding role for the private sector in the economy Following the crash of 2007 Labour under Ed Miliband has still to decide whether to make the break from that consensus The observation that the Church of England amounts to the Tory party at prayer is thought to date to the 18th century Thatcher s terms of office severely damaged that relationship possibly beyond repair The publication in 1985 of the C of E report Faith in the City A Call to Action by Church and Nation caused an almighty political row between the church and the Conservative party which has reverberated to the present day Endorsed by Dr Robert Runcie then archbishop of Canterbury the document followed riots in Britain s inner cities It was a cry of anguish over the dilapidated alienated state of the inner cities after years of recession gloom and rising unemployment Relations between the Tories and the established church have never truly recovered Thatcher saw the BBC licence fee as a tax imposed on television viewers irrespective of whether they wanted to watch BBC programmes or not As prime minister she believed that a leftwing bias permeated its coverage During the Falklands war rightwingers renamed the corporation the Stateless Persons Broadcasting Corporation a dig at its refusal to describe British troops as our troops and Argentinian soldiers as the enemy It was hoped that the 1990 Broadcasting Act would tame the institution forcing it to outsource at least 25 of its production

and description of Nelson Mandela as a terrorist arguably delayed the fall of that regime", "There was a point in this semi final when it had looked as though Chelsea were simply going to be overwhelmed They can reflect on a spirited effort during the final exchanges but it is no good playing well for only the last third of a match and hoping to get away with it Roberto Mancini s team won not just because they had more verve in attack but also because they were far less erratic and from here it is difficult to envisage them not returning the trophy to Manchester They had pinned Chelsea back for much of the opening hour and however great their relief at the final whistle Mancini was entitled to point out they probably had enough chances to spare their supporters that nerve shredding ordeal in which Chelsea s late desperate efforts were epitomised by David Luiz all but abandoning defence to join their attack Rafael Ben tez s team finished with virtually half a team encamped in the final third of the pitch as they tried to recover the goals from Samir Nasri and Sergio Ag ero Yet City defended with great togetherness during the considerable pressure that followed Demba Ba s goal midway through the second half These were moments too when Costel Pantilimon fully justified Mancini s decision to play him at the expense of Joe Hart Pantilimon has featured in all of City s FA Cup ties and coped so well that Mancini immediately promised the Romanian would keep his place when the team return to Wembley to face Wigan Athletic on 11 May City looking to win this competition for the second time in three years have been installed as 1 5 favourites If they play as they did for the opening hour it is difficult to see how Wigan will stop them City had dominated that period to such an extent passing the ball with great purpose the late drama that occurred had barely seemed plausible Ag ero and Carlos Tevez formed a strike partnership of great menace both operating with a licence to roam such elusive and dangerous opponents Nasri showed why Mancini has been willing to persevere with him David Silva s absence with a hamstring injury could have been a considerable loss Instead Mancini s team began the match precisely as they had left off against Manchester United the previous Monday This is the fourth time they have played Chelsea this season and they have been the more refined team on each occasion They had already started to pin Chelsea back well before Nasri put them into a 35th minute lead Yaya Tour the game s outstanding player started the move with one of those powerful surges through the centre of midfield Nasri ran on to Ag ero s layoff and C sar Azpilicueta could not get a clean tackle on the Frenchman The ricochet was kind to Nasri and he swept in his goal from six yards It arrived at the first point of the match when Chelsea had started to emerge from their own half For the most part however Juan Mata Eden Hazard and Oscar were only on the edges of the opening45 minutes Chelsea looked flat and unimaginative perhaps a little weary too bearing in mind their unforgiving schedule It was rare to see one of Ben tez s teams playing with such little cohesion and structure and defensively so poor at keeping a straight line Chelsea badly missed John Terry not the fading Terry who had struggled against Rubin Kazan last Thursday but the organiser of old Ag ero s goal was a perfectly angled header from Gareth Barry s cross and at that stage there was little sense of a possible comeback Ag ero was a constant threat though fortunate late on that his studs up lunge at Luiz was not punished James Milner made it a difficult day for Ryan Bertrand deputising for the injured Ashley Cole and Tour in particular was excellent as close as there is to the complete midfield player Yet the complexion of the game changed immeasurably when Luiz s long ball went over Vincent Kompany and Ba swivelled away from Matija Nastasic then hooked his shot past Pantilimon Suddenly it was City s turn to look anxious while still highly dangerous on the counter attack exploiting the gaps that appeared as Luiz and others took up more advanced positions It was a breathless finale that saw Pantilimon save brilliantly at Mata s feet keep out another effort from Ba and Fernando Torres so aggrieved that he had not been awarded a penalty after grappling with Kompany he sulkily gestured that the referee Chris Foy needed glasses Pantilimon s only moment of hesitancy came in the first half when he misjudged the flight of Mata s free kick but was spared greater scrutiny because Kompany was able to clear Hazard s shot from the line Chelsea should probably have done more in this period to test the goalkeeper s nerve As it is all they have left is the Europa League For City there is the prospect of the third major trophy of the Mancini era Not the one they wanted possibly but a trophy they would cherish all the same Man of the match Yaya Tour

never done that before from a low draw I pressed the rewind button on the TV controls to check that this genius really did say that Another theory was that the Sydney jockeys would get together and lock her up which is local speak for boxing her in on the rail Luke Nolen her jockey clearly gave this some credence He came off the rail to make sure they couldn t put him in a pocket quicker than a bride s nightie The commentator had a nifty turn of phrase There s no move that a horse or jockey can make that he did not have a phrase for They either went flat out like a lizard drinking or dragged their noses on their knees In the third race he spotted someone snagging one back through the field I m not sure whether that was a good thing or not But every move the jockeys make is scrutinised by

all but signed and sealed now On the field they can do no more Off it their only hope is the kind of political impasse that nearly denied them their own promotion last summer The bad news is the principal contenders for the Championship title fully intend and are equipped to come up And even if they did not Welsh s administration is falling apart at the seams Their majority shareholder Kelvin Bryon is withdrawing his support and this weekend launched a bitter attack on the authorities of the English game accusing them of breaking competition law in the way clubs are funded John Taylor the former chief executive and vice chairman is said to have stood down as well and there were rumours that Tony Copsey the chief executive since the beginning of the year has resigned Welsh would not confirm either development but Taylor s name was removed on Saturday along with Bryon s from the club s list of directors with Companies House As preparation for a key match all of the above was hardly ideal and sure enough on the day their captain Jonathan Mills withdrew from this home fixture against play off chasing Northampton It was a hideous series of blows One marvels that they were able to make a game at all of this a match they had to win to have any hope of moving off the bottom before the season is out in two rounds time They gave it a lash not just doing the old backs against the wall thing so often characteristic of the underdog but by trying to play their way out of the predicament They had a scrum that at least matched the mighty set piece of Northampton and some of their approach work was dazzling even if the final ball was lacking They were up against a side of far greater resource and pedigree who were on something of a mission themselves but the final fateful result here did not do them justice Credit must go to Lyn Jones the coach who has moulded performances like this from the kind of meagre resources that Bryon had railed against in his parting shot Jones spoke of a tearful changing room but he at least was upbeat about his experience in the Premiership It s definitely been worthwhile he said What our directors have got to do is take this positive experience away with them understand what it s all about and come back with a better plan But what kind of a board of directors will be left after this latest fall out What kind of a club Welsh are intent on staying at the Kassam Stadium but crowds have been disappointing Bryon s hope before the season had been of attracting gates of seven or eight thousand but the reality ended up being three or four This was only their fourth crowd in excess offive thousand and most of the noise was made by the visiting fans This will be an even emptier home in the Championship and when they get there they will not have happy tales to tell about the way they were treated in the top flight The five point penalty they received over the Mike Scott affair appears to have been the final blow not only to their hopes of survival but to the enthusiasm of such key figures in the boardroom I don t think that episode was a big boost said Jones in his understated way It took a lot of energy away from the club a lot of time and effort The process that must be endured by any new side seeking promotion to the Premiership is a treacherous affair which puts the promoted club at a severe disadvantage even if they have everything in place off the field London Welsh did not because their promotion caught everyone by surprise themselves included However much bureaucracy has contributed to their subsequent relegation their season in the Premiership leaves them with an uncertain future What happens at board level is not for me to comment upon said Jones but what the club has to do is hold its nerve Obviously we ve known what s going on for several days weeks so there s already a plan For me it s about bouncing back up next year I have ambition I want to be a winner and I hope my directors do too And they do The club will be strong and we will be taking on Bristol to win the Championship next year I can t guarantee that though because we don t know what s going to happen tomorrow You never know with London Welsh It s a very exciting club But there s a steely focus What is not at question is the contribution Jones s players have made towards matters on the field They took the lead with a length of the field try by Nick Scott sparked by Sonny Parker s interception on the half hour but two tries by Tom May in as many minutes the second a long range beauty established the Saints a 19 7 lead at the break which was never really threatened thereafter for all Welsh s spirit and acumen Two late Northampton tries earned Northampton the bonus point that all but earns them a place in the play offs By then though London Welsh s fate had long since been sealed It is dearly to be hoped that this setback has limited repercussions for their future London Welsh

Australian endured one of the toughest weekends of his career in China after suffering issues that wrecked both his qualifying and grand prix Coming three weeks after Webber left Malaysia considering his future in light of team mate Sebastian Vettel ignoring orders to take a win that should have been his the past two days will have been a bitter pill to swallow In qualifying yesterday the team adequately failed to fill Webber s car with fuel due to a fault with the bowser resulting in him stopping on track during Q2 and a penalty that saw him dumped to the back of the grid The team at least made the right call in starting Webber from the pit lane as it allowed them to work overnight on set up for the car Come lap 15 Webber was pushing for eighth place only to run into the Toro Rosso of Jean Eric Vergne Alonso wins as Hamilton holds on for third F1 Standings and race calendar Alonso triumphs in Shanghai Chinese Grand Prix 2013 as it happened Hamilton on pole for Chinese GP Webber sent to back of grid The stewards have looked dimly upon the incident as they have punished the 36 year old with a three place penalty for next Sunday s race in Bahrain The collision forced Webber into the pits for a front wing and tyre change as he had punctured the front left However on Webber s next lap he incurred further woes as he began touring reaching the hairpin at turn 14 where the left rear wheel worked loose finally bringing him to a halt Suggested to Horner there is currently a conspiracy against Webber it provoked an angry response It s complete rubbish forget conspiracy said Horner We re all about trying to get two cars to the finish as high as we can Anybody who thinks there is a conspiracy here against either driver does not know what they are looking at Pointed out to Horner that Webber was not as vehemently dismissive when such a theory was put to him yesterday Horner replied Mark knows exactly what happened exactly That s it There is no conspiracy Horner however will not know the exact reason why Webber s wheel fell off until after an investigation of the car Until we get the car back we re not too sure said Horner Prior to that he had an incident with Jean Eric and damaged the front wing and we had a puncture on the left front so all four wheels were changed and the nose was changed The report from the gun man who had extra time because it wasn t a hectic stop due to the nose change was that the right rear was secure and done up tightly So it s difficult to make any assumptions Whether it s as a result of the incident the contact I don t know Unlikely I would have thought but until we have all the information it s difficult to draw any conclusions Horner has no doubts Webber will bounce back strongly from two tough weekends He was driving very well and was coming back through the field after we had made some big changes overnight to assist him to do that added Horner The way his strategy was going it was working very well for him and he was back in the thick of it The contact was unfortunate and then to have to retire the car was even more unfortunate But he ll be fine He s a tough competitor Edited by Vicki Hodges", "This was close to a perfect afternoon s work for Manchester United Sir Alex Ferguson s side re established their 15 point lead over Manchester City at the top of the Premier League after cruising to a comfortable victory over Stoke City that saw Robin van Persie end his goal drought with a penalty kick quickly followed by a bear hug that almost knocked his manager off his feet He nearly killed me He forgets I m 71 Ferguson said Van Persie s goal was his first in 751 minutes of football stretching back more than two months and put United in a commanding position after Michael Carrick had earlier registered his first league goal of the season stabbing the ball home inside four minutes to inflict an early blow on a Stoke City side hovering precariously above the relegation zone on the back of a calamitous run of results With Wayne Rooney catching the eye in central midfield alongside Carrick while Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic dominated at the back United s title aspirations never looked like being blown off course on a blustery day at the Britannia Stadium If results go their way United could be confirmed champions as early as Sunday 24 hours before they host Aston Villa although it remains more likely that the Premier League trophy will be back in their hands when they visit Arsenal on 28 April Either way it is a matter of when and not if with Monday night s home defeat against Manchester City flushed out of the system here For Van Persie it was a day of considerable satisfaction and as the forward admitted no little relief The way in which he celebrated his goal running to the touchline to embrace Ferguson before high fiving those on the United bench provided a measure of how grateful he was for the backing both public and private he has received at a time when he was looking unrecognisable from the striker that terrorised defences earlier in the season and at one stage seemed nailed on to be named Footballer of the Year I had to score that one and thankfully it went in Van Persie said The relief of a couple of weeks came out I wanted to celebrate with everyone players and staff and all players on the bench as they have been great to me from day one Even when it is a little harder they still support me and believe in me and help me when they can That s why I wanted everyone to join in Ferguson for whom this was a 900th victory as United manager was delighted for Van Persie For all strikers and I was one myself you go through spells when you are not scoring and thinking you will never get a goal Then when you are scoring you never think you are going to miss It was an important goal and there were two or three things about it He did really good work from Wayne s pass to get to the penalty Then the ball moved off the spot two or three times and he showed composure to settle himself down and score a perfect penalty low hard and into the corner Stoke could hardly have got off to a worse start The fact the concession came via a set piece the area where Stoke with no shortage of height expect to be causing opponents problems rubbed salt into the wound Van Persie s inswinging corner got a slight touch off Kenwyne Jones and after Geoff Cameron blocked Phil Jones s acrobatic attempt to hook home Carrick reacted quickest Robert Huth should have done better with a header from a Glenn Whelan free kick but that was a rare Stoke chance in a first half in which United were coasting and Rooney seemed to be enjoying himself He was brilliant Ferguson said I was thinking he possibly needed a different role in terms of getting his confidence back He has been under a bit of criticism not serious but there were some doubters nonetheless I thought a spell in midfield would do him the world of good and it worked for us It was a Rooney pass that led to Van Persie winning the penalty that put the game beyond a Stoke side that improved as the game went on but offered little in the way of a genuine threat Andy Wilkinson needlessly swept Van Persie s feet from under him leaving Jonathan Moss the referee with no option but to point to the spot The striker had squandered a decent chance earlier in the second half when he struck the side netting after being superbly put through by Javier Hern ndez but he made no mistake this time Man of the match Wayne Rooney Manchester United", "Your IP address will be logged Live

because it s about to get pwopa nawtee Alternatively a football match might break out Although this is a match featuring Sunderland who haven t been especially concerned with entertainment this season Watching their games has been a form of slow torture They really have served up some unashamed filth sitting back defending defending some more and then hoping that Steven Fletcher nicks a goal out of nothing Of course with Fletcher out for the rest of the season it s not entirely clear who s supposed to have that role now but then there have been some changes at Sunderland in recent weeks Yes that s the best way of putting it Changes A new direction You might have heard about it in the news Under Martin O Neill Sunderland were floundering so who better to spice things up than Di Canio And what could be better for his second match in charge than a trip to Newcastle Newcastle will no doubt be looking to increase the hurt on Sunderland who are only out of the bottom three due to their superior goal difference over Wigan There were small signs of improvement during Di Canio s debut against Chelsea last week but they still lost and Sunderland haven t won since January There s no way of dressing it up any other way they have been pure dreck this season and it remains to be seen whether Di Canio s presence can save them He appears to have something but it might not be enough to save this side though a win at St James Park could transform their season Not that Newcastle are about to stand aside politely and let them waltz off with the three points They re not quite out of the woods yet and probably need another win to ensure Pardew s hubristic comments about not having to worry about relegation last month don t come back to haunt them That wouldn t be funny at all Kick off

is going home at Masters champion LEADERBOARD Day Cabrera 8 Snedeker 7 Scott 6 Leishman Westwood 4 Langer Olesen 3 FInal day of 77th Masters gets under way Three way tie at the top Woods struggles on opening holes Leaderboard and round four tee times Interactive course guide to Augusta National Golf Course 20 31 Just not dropping for Woods his putt from the fringe of six looks him dead in the eye and says I m not going in there pal He stays at 2 Snedeker has a similar conversation with his ball at the fourth and the American drops his first shot in nearly two days to move back to 7 20 26 Never write off anybody at the Masters but there are a few challenges starting to peter away Leishman might be one of those with a bogey at four his putt for par far too short Thorbjorn Olesen who is suffering from whiplash is remarkably 3 for the week with a storming back nine four birdies and just the single bogey seems him turn in 33 20 22 Shot gone for Woods at five is that the Masters gone for this year too He s now six behind with holes running out steadily Westwood starts to make a nation believe if only for an hour or so as he holes a putt at the seventh to go four under par four off the lead Scott holds the fourth to stick at six under 20 17 After the fireworks of the first two holes Day does well to keep pars at three and four He s back to the steady solid play we saw yesterday Cabrera goes short with his birdie attempt at three and remains 8 Langer has a really tough putt from the edge of the green once more for par but fails to find it from about 20 feet he drops back to 3 and his blistering start has hit the speedbump 20 15 Nerves from Scott They might have just fluttered away scattered like confetti in the Georgian air It s a big attempt for birdie at three about 15 feet away but it s nailed He s back up to 6 two off the lead A little tidbit from a bit further along the course much like Na previously Bubba struggles at the 12th and shoots a seven over 10 20 13 Cabrera joins the leaders once more with a birdie at the second the Argentine could have even made eagle but he ll settle for 8 along with Snedeker and Day These three are just giving a little glance over their shoulders and wondering if they will put the turbo on Langer s putting finally fails him at six his par attempt at the fringe not Edinburgh refuses to drop He s back to four under par 20 08 Tiger has started pretty quietly with three pars through three A chance for birdie at four wide He taps his cap but is still fairly annoyed at his slow but steady start Earlier he was having the time of his life riding this invisible micropig 20 03 Leishman and Scott make par that will loosen them a little especially Scott It s been said a lot from people that Scott winning would be nice karma but karma doesn t keep your hand steady and your head even steadier 19 59 Rain begins to fall Splish splash splosh it goes as Westwood sees a putt for birdie break right he stays on 3 through five Scott s birdie effort is weak as a malnourished contortionist and he ll have a tough putt for par Leishman his two ball partner is deep in the bunker but plays it out well Another spot on putt from Langer keeps him on 5 along with the aforementioned duo from down under 19 57 Are nerves getting the better of Scott here A dropped shot at the first and a very very tentative play along the second his third shot rests on the longer stuff on the edge of the green It will be a two putt for par 19 53 Pull up a chair Snedeker the view is lovely in the lead He joins Day within seconds with a birdie at the first The Sned hasn t dropped a shot here since the ninth on Friday phenomenal and the reason he s favourite going into today 19 49 Woops and hollers all over the second Day is in the lead It s an eagle at the second Sensational chip out of the bunker sees him go birdie eagle cancelling out those final two holes yesterday and then some He s eight under par This has started in a whirlwind fashion Clark gets his dropped shot back at two to go 3 once more It s all happening here 19 47 Langer has ice in his veins Nothing to do with today that statistic just a little known fact about him It helps with his putting he s got a toughie to save par at four from 10 feet and makes it So too Westwood who has his putting in form for now 19 45 Well held Rose The lengthy putts to make birdies and pars are getting holed and there s cheers swirling around No such luck for Scott the Aussie drops one at the first with his eight footer breaking a little too right He s down to 5 19 39 Rose is in the bunker at seven but his approach shot isn t too hot and he ll struggle to stay level par Snedeker and Cabrera about to tee off will one of these be the Masters champion as they walk onto the 18th green Snedeker is in a dashing pink number very smart Cabrera is in a white shirt a bit too big for him and looks ready to hit the dancefloor 19 35 Masters Sunday has arrived Day birdies the first to move to 6 with yet another one putt he was a machine until the final two holes yesterday which brought him bogey woe He s now at 6 one off the lead Big cheer at the third for the luminous Langer he s gone birdie birdie birdie after another smart mid length putt to go within two of the lead He might look like a gym instructor that s had one too many cocktails at the bar but he s golfing royalty and he s charging up the leaderboard 19 32 Tiger is in the trees at the second and he punches his way out without issue Westwood is on the edge of the green at the third and chips it within three feet of the hole should be a par but with Westy s putting there s no guarantees 19 29 Some really good golf getting played here at the early stages but not so much for Clark who bogeys the first after an erratic approach onto the tee left him with a little too much to do He s down to 2 Rickie Fowler straps himself into the rollercoaster for the final time he s 1 through one and one under for the week 19 24 Birdie for Langer He s up to 4 just three off the leader Westwood makes birdie as well to move to 3 A bit further down the course Schwartzel nearly holes one of the most incredible putts you ll see He is standing vertical to the ninth hole but knocks it at a 90 degree angle to his right It rolls around and around but just misses It s all gone a bit crazy golf out there Incredible example of what these greens can do 19 21 Langer is looking in good nick already though not hard to do so wearing a snazzy orange number His massive eagle put from somewhere in Canada is just short but that should be two birdies over the first two holes for him Woods birdie opportunity drifts short as well par at the first 19 14 Played Mr Couples He holes a birdie at six from the edge of the green to move back to level par McIlroy finishes his week with his best round 69 but ends it 2 overall 19 13 Tim Clark at the first tee polite applause good drive Woods in red rapturous applause drives it near the trees Go figure Love him hate him there s few better sights in sport than Tiger in red He s never come from behind on the last day to win a major however Keep that in mind before you get all giggly and excited 19 09 Weather watch from The Telegraph s James Corrigan There s a storm heading towards Augusta A real one Nothing to do with Tiger or a 14 year old or a drop or a clock There s probably one brewing at 13 too Na has just smashed his second shot into the creek Time to go home pal 19 06 Oooof first little move at the leaders from Bernhard Langer perhaps The 55 year old has a pretty tough downhill putt for birdie from 15 feet on greens far from kind but drains it front and centre to move to 3 19 00 Kevin Na is great entertainment A bit loopy but good fun He talks to his ball as he was arguing with his wife around Ikea He finds the water off the tee three times at the 12th He will be getting horrible flashbacks to this moment in 2011 at the Valero Texas Open when took 16 shots Here at Augusta he flashes a wry smile as he putts for 10 seven over par He goes 16 Not that it will really matter to him They re all just numbers now 18 55 McIlroy decked in grey how relevant of him bags a birdie at 16 to go three under for the round and 2 overall David Lynn leader at some point way back on Thursday bogeys 17 to go to 5 for the week level par today 18 52 If a picture could tell a thousand words it would probably be a bit more interesting than this However it does give some indication of the week champion Bubba has had his erratic driving proving his downfall He s level through eight today and 2 overall Hope he s been practising his dressing technique for the winner later 18 50 Jonathan Liew has kept us busy all week with his view from Augusta a big thank you to him Here s his latest on the final day Sandy Lyle in chipper mood after posting a 71 his best round of the week It s been an encouraging partial return to form for him and there were a few glimpses of the old magic out there his birdie putt at the 1st his superb chips at 13 14 15 and 18 his sublime tee shot to the 16th feeding back down the slope and rolling to 2ft Still he finishes on 9 for the tournament Back to the old farts next week he muttered as he strode back into the clubhouse 18 46 Hello England s Rose Justin Rose that is He s out on course pars the first and birdies the second big effort needed for him to do anything of note today He s back under par at 1 Charl Schwartzel the man I put my week s wages on to win this tournament birdies five to give me a slight twinge Alas he s on level par for the week and the 2011 champion will not feature in the final shake up 18 39 Haas is not quite on fire but he s sparking a little two birdies through three puts him on 1 It would be a mammoth effort from him or anyone that far behind to be in amongst the final standings He s giving it a good go however so too good old Gonzalo Fernandez Castano who birdies the first and goes two under 18 34 Continuing the theme of cuddly golfers Phil Mickelson shoots a 73 in a weekend that never got going Rarely will you see big Phil go no lower than 71 at Augusta He ends nine over par 18 25 Lyle will cuddle a 71 in the clubhouse and a score of 9 for the week He s definitely a cuddler Sandy His four days read 73 72 81 71 Spot the bum round Guan finishes the day three over and 12 overall The golfing world shall anticipate his return next year when he ll be 15 yes 15 and probably at the goth emo stage of adolescence 18 20 Ishikawa doing his best to re enact the flamingo scene in Alice In Wonderland there He s on 4 for the day through 16 though that still isn t the best score out there right now Michael Thompson surprise winner of the Honda Classic earlier in the year has picked up four birdies on the back nine to go five under through 16 The American still remains on 2 overall however Curiouser and curiouser 18 15 Freddie Freddie Freddie The sleep hasn t had much effect on Couples it appears he drops a shot at the first to move to 1 Much like Sergio Garcia the thought of him winning was nice while it lasted but the deadening blow of reality knocks us all cold 18 09 Couple of early movers up the leaderboard Birdies galore for Watson KJ Choi Bill Haas Freddie Jacobson and John Huh the only player on tour whose name can be translated as yer wha early doors Jason Dufner looked to be mounting a bit of a challenge at one point yesterday namely at the eighth when he went five under par but he s now 2 after a double bogey at the first He ll look even sadder than usual 17 58 Lyle nabs that birdie on 16 to go 8 for the week as does Guan to move back up to 11 Fred Couples bang in the mix until dropping four shots on the final five holes is teeing off

the items his caddy bag a projector screen a snooker table and a wall Back to the drawing board What doesn t kill you makes you stronger I will be stronger 17 43 Guan might be one of the stories of the week but his two ball partner Sandy Lyle deserves a little nod of acknowledgement The 1988 Masters champion missed the cut in his previous three Augusta appearances but he s enjoyed a decent week here He s 9 overall but looks set to go under par today with three holes remaining especially after an excellent tee shot at the par three 16th which leaves him three feet from the hole Partner Guan 41 years his junior responds by doing the same thing Belter 17 39 Keegan Bradley was tipped heavily by some after his recent form his past four tournaments have yielded four top 10 finishes No top 10 for him this year with a score of 9 He is the first man to finish today and he s home in a respectable 69 at least 17 35 Is this the moment Tiger truly comes back After all the false alarms all the cries of he s back with every birdie on the PGA Tour all the column inches and flittering opinions is this the moment where we get tangible proof that this remarkable golfer is still amongst the elite It would be his 15th major After all he s been through over the past few years self inflicted admittedly that he would win it after such a strange stressful week would be almost apt Is this his best chance of his first major since Torrey Pines in 2008 There s plenty who will beg to differ The owner of this flag for starters with three genuine chances for a first time Australian winner of the Masters 17 19 Away from Azinger s musings and back on course Henrik Stenson birdies two and three to go 1 overall He of elongated vowels Luke Donald has suffered a disappointing week and day four

on though The first hole looks to be a bit tricky today only four birdies so far and a fair few bogeys It will be interesting how those mingling at two under par set out attack it from the off or gently ease into the round Tactics on Masters Sunday play a big part aside from last year of course when Bubba Watson boomed his way around in frantic style 16 47 Players are already out on the course

boys get going What a day in prospect People flock around television screens to see who will be adorned in one of the most iconic prizes in sport while those not into golf wonder what all the fuss is about Out there somewhere is a narrative waiting to be written Is this the time of Angel Cabrera the 2009 champion who has appeared from nowhere well Argentina to share the lead with his son as caddy Is this the moment Australia finally has a Masters champion Is it written for Adam Scott to finally banish that evil final day of Lytham or could one of the less fancied ones Jason Day or Marc

back semi finals won by the odd goal in seven after finishing 3 3 in normal time what are the chances of that happening Sunday s instalment at Hampden Park was not a mirror image of the previous day s mesmerising contest between Hibernian and Falkirk but it was just as compelling Celtic ended a sequence of three consecutive defeats at the national stadium but the outcome remained uncertain until Craig Thomson sounded the final whistle after half an hour of extra time had been extended by a further two minutes The roar that emanated from the Celtic support and their management team was composed of equal parts acclaim and relief For their part United deserved the salutes of their followers disappointed but proud of the team s full blooded attempt to overcome the odds and their gift to Celtic of a goal of a start Hibs into Scottish Cup final Saturday s event featured a slew of teenagers mostly in Falkirk colours but United threw cadets into this battle in the shape of John Souttar the 16 year old who earlier this season became the youngest player every to wear a senior shirt at Tannadice and Ryan Gauld at the age of 17 The youngsters were entitled to wonder what exactly they had been thrust into when Celtic went ahead after a minute Prompted by Victor Wanyama Kris Commons bored straight through the middle of the United half shrugged aside Mark Millar and cracked a left foot drive beyond Radoslaw Cierzniak whose first touch of the ball was to retrieve it from his net Many a team conceding early to one or other of the Old Firm sides in Glasgow have crumpled under the burden but to United s considerable credit they bedded into the game and looked undaunted by their task Even so the game might easily have run away from them when Mikael Lustig got on the end of a typically incisive cross from Emilio Izaguirre in the 20th minute but the Swede headed against the post when he should have scored United s response was to strike twice in six minutes Their equaliser was a delight flowing from one end to the other from Barry Douglas through Jon Daly and wide right to Gary Mackay Steven who played a give and go with Gauld before curling his finish around Fraser Forster When they took the lead it was from a well tried combination a Douglas free kick on to the six yard line for Daly to head home The tangerine faithful had not even got through their first celebratory chorus when Celtic were back on level terms after another pinpoint delivery from Izaguirre invited Wanyama to outjump Douglas and bounce his header away from Cierznak Three goals in half an hour on Saturday had sent some Hibs fans scurrying for the exits but with four goals shared inside the same span on this occasion anybody choosing to leave their seat did so in peril of missing more of the same at each end It took until the hour mark for that to happen and again Izaguirre forced the opening with a cross which struck Commons evidently on the arm before crossing the line With a hat trick in prospect Commons pursued scraps of possession like a ravenous hound but it was Daly who found the mark again beautifully peeling into space between Wilson and Izaguirre to float his header home Full time arrived with the final still beckoning for both teams although not for Wanyama or Beram Kayal both of whom had earned cautions that precluded a return visit to Hampden For a brief tantalising moment in the first half of extra time it seemed as though the Terrors were about to nose in front again with a repeat ploy as Daly met a Douglas corner kick with a header that beat Forster but skipped back off the post Within four minutes United s Dubliner was outdone by his fellow citizen in the Hoops attack as Anthony Stokes rose to connect with a cross from James Forrest and headed forcefully past Czerniak to ensure a collision of the greens in the final against Hibs on May 26 Match details Dundee United 4 4 1 1 Cierzniak Watson Souttar Dillon Douglas Mackay Steven Flood

tries for a bonus point victory to guarantee themselves a home semi final in the denouement of the Aviva Premiership campaign but there was plenty to debate here Complaints from fans had arisen over the minute s silence for former PM Margaret Thatcher in her former constituency Worcester centre Josh Matavesi may face a citing charge for a dangerous tackle and the visitor s director of rugby Richard Hill revealed he is a grass man after criticising the playing surface It was one of those days Spring had finally arrived the sun shone and the players delivered a cricket score The disastrous away form of Worcester continued as they found themselves swamped 23 3 down after only 25 minutes with wing David Strettle imperious crossing for a hat trick of first half tries But for a period of rebuttal in the second half Worcester were dominated London Welsh 14 Northampton 31 Harlequins 23 Bath 9 Exeter Chiefs 27 London Irish 6 Sale Sharks 32 Gloucester 9 Exiles Jones remains upbeat A fifteen minute period after the turnaround was the only solace after they were hammered up front in the first half momentarily Saracens took their foot off the throttle and the vim and vigour of the Warriors paid off They scored tries through Josh Drauniniu and Matt Kvesic both converted from the touchline by Danny Gray and at 23 17 briefly the game was on But it was short lived Saracens were soon on top again taking full advantage of the space their ebullient forwards created running in tries by Carlos Nieto Chris Ashton and Jackson Wray the final score reflecting the balance of the game Outside half Charlie Hodgson converted four of the tries and kicked three penalties A minute s silence for the passing of former PM Margaret Thatcher was observed with solemnity at the ground within her former constituency of Finchley There had been some opposition from Saracens fans to the insistence on the minute s memorial Some people tried to politicise it said Edward Griffiths the club s chief executive officer In sport we suffer from the tyranny of the messageboard and half a dozen people can give an impression The minute s silence was observed impeccably by the fans Indeed it was with the ground filled to its capacity 9 995 for the fourth time in succession Worth remembering another soul lost forever here that of Peter Deakin once one of rugby s great marketing innovators It is near enough the ten year anniversary of Deakin passing away from a brain cancer He first brought the Fez to the fore and the club s theme tunes That was much in evidence on Sunday at this now vibrant establishment Deakin studied the sports industry market in America and understood its razzamatazz He made Bradford Bulls big at the box office So successful was he Saracens owner Nigel Wray lured him to Vicarage Road Let s not forget that Watford is to rugby what mountain climbing is to Holland Nonetheless Deakin delivered five figure crowds including a record 19 000 at Vicarage Road Deakin would have smiled at the cricket score here and the packed stands The match was not without incident which is likely to be policed by an RFU citing officer Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall was unhappy with a late challenge on scrum half Neil de Kock Worcester centre Matavesi flattened de Kock with a high hard hit which led to McCall leaving his seat to go to the touchline where he argued animatedly with the officials It was a horrendous challenge and we could have lost our scrum half for the rest of the season with a broken jaw or cheekbone said McCall Fortunately he seems to be ok but it looked pretty deliberate to me Explaining why he had gone to the touchline he explained I leapt up as I felt it could have been a deliberate game ploy from Worcester I wanted the officials to know he might need protection Hill admitted it was a very clumsy challenge but insisted Matavesi is not a malicious player A citing does seem likely added Hill", "A 23 year old man has

2013 Comments Skipper Morgan Larsen helming in the absence of billionaire team owner Ernesto Bertarelli cruised to a double points win in the final race even though he and his crew had the Singapore victory wrapped up before it started In a challenging four days of racing where the relentlessly light airs tested the most experienced temperaments Larsen who in his first season of Extreme racing last year won two of the seven Acts proved difficult to beat on a tiny race track squeezed into Marina Bay Alinghi finished with a massive 35 point win sweeping to victory in seven of the 23 races leaving 2012 champions The Wave Muscat in fifth place their worst performance since October 2011 ten regattas ago Disappointed skipper Leigh McMillan said they had been taken by surprise when after two hours of exhibition racing forced on the fleet by the lack of breeze race officials suddenly announced the final race was about to start leaving all the teams with little time to prepare We thought we had a good strategy it just didn t quite pan out for us he said Brothers go into battle for Extreme honours Extreme fleet set for game of fiddle dee dee in Singapore Next Volvo Ocean Race 2014 15 set to be toughest ever Ainslie retirement clears Rio 2016 path for Giles Scott ahead of Princess Sofia Trophy The fleet got away and there were no options to come back into the race so it was decided there and then American Larsen who skippered The Wave Muscat s sister ship Oman Air before being snapped up by Bertarelli is one of the most experienced sailors in the sport with four America s Cup campaigns and three Maxi World Championships under his belt As runner up last year and with such a convincing win in tough conditions in Singapore he will now rank as a favourite for the 2013 title along with McMillan and Red Bull s Roman Hagara The duel between the Greenhalgh brothers Rob and Pete fell away when Team Aberdeen Singapore the local invitational team struggled to master the conditions with just one win and three podium places and The Wave Muscat where Pete has been a regular for two years failed to reverse their disappointing form", "When Paolo Di Canio celebrated St phane Sess gnon s opening goal during Sunderland s first victory here in 13 years it was quite a sight His sprint down the touchline however marked only the beginning of a glorious day for his new club that will be long remembered by those who made the short journey from Wearside on Sunday and have had to endure so much misery in this derby over recent years Di Canio in true Jos Mourinho style slid along the turf and beat his chest like a madman when Adam Johnson curled in a stunning second with 16 minutes remaining ruining his pristine suit trousers in the process Then as David Vaughan rifled in a third after 82 minutes the whole Sunderland bench surged into an almighty red and white scrum led by their manager I would like to lose my trousers every weekend Di Canio said I will lose all my money I wanted to go far but I couldn t because I m too old I only have 20 yards in my legs now In the end it was Newcastle who were caught with their pants down and despite having a legitimate Papiss Ciss effort ruled out for offside they did not deserve anything from this match Sunderland climbed three points away from the teams in the relegation zone and in the process dragged Newcastle back into the dogfight only two points separate the two sides in the Premier League table and given the home side s tough fixture list they are not out of the scrap just yet Alan Pardew blamed fatigue for the defeat following Thursday night s Europa League game with Benfica He may have a point but Sunderland looked more dangerous from the off They could have been awarded an early penalty had Howard Webb signalled to the spot for Steven Taylor s tug on Danny Graham as the striker a Newcastle supporter was unable to get his shot off from close range and tumbled to the ground Sunderland did not have to wait A careless pass from Jon s Guti rrez in midfield was intercepted by James McLean who broke swiftly up the left flank cutting a pass inside for Sess gnon and with Taylor backing away the Benin international fired a precise low shot past Tim Krul from the edge of the D grazing the goalkeeper s right hand post as it nestled into the corner Pardew said in his programme notes that he hoped Sunderland stay up even the most hardened Newcastle supporter would miss the clashes against Sunderland but one wonders if he feels the same now His frustration was all too apparent when in the 62nd minute Ciss steered a flick on into the back of the net only to be flagged offside by Darren Cann Carlos Cu llar was clearly playing him on Newcastle s frustration was building and they were again denied when Simon Mignolet tipped behind Guti rrez s effort intended as a cross but one that was arcing into the top corner Mignolet made a number of outstanding stops to keep Newcastle at bay but after his opposite number Krul was forced off after dislocating a shoulder an injury that rules him out for the remainder of the campaign his replacement Rob Elliot was helpless to prevent a collapse Johnson s goal was a wonderful strike and an example of the quality he possesses albeit if his form has been inconsistent this season The winger picked up the ball on Sunderland s right and cut inside before sending a curling effort past Elliot with his left foot The result seemed assured but more drama was to come Vaughan rifling an unstoppable shot into the top corner from the left edge of the penalty area to send Sunderland s fans and Di Canio into ecstasy It was a tough day said Pardew who claimed that he didn t see Di Canio s celebrations We looked a little bit tired in our minds and in our application to the game We did get a lift after 60 minutes but the linesman even denied us that which might have changed proceedings slightly Unfortunately it turned out to be a great day for Sunderland and an awful day for us It s up there with his worst moments in charge for sure The team just didn t perform today as we would have wanted Even the introduction of Shola Ameobi dubbed the Mackem Slayer in these parts due to his potent scoring record against Sunderland could not change the sway of this match There was not even the faintest hint of Mackem slaying to celebrate Instead Sunderland secured their biggest victory at St James Park since 1979 and Di Canio went from villain to hero in the space of a breathtaking 90 minutes Man of the match St phane Sess gnon Sunderland", "Leicester are cantering to a home semi final and probably a ninth consecutive Twickenham final after a forgettable five try beating of an underpowered Wasps side who looked to have their minds elsewhere After Wasps European labours last week their coach Dai Young made seven changes Leicester responding just before the kick off by giving three England internationals the day off and still pocketing a try bonus point four minutes into the second half when Ben Youngs darted in for his second Adam Thompstone completed the job before Elliot Daly scooted home from 60 metres to show the sell out 24 000 crowd what they were missing Wasps once the big thorn in Tigers paw have not won at Leicester in five seasons and have an away record showing 23 defeats in 25 games They picked a side not to win said the Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill but we ll accept the result Having lost their last five Premiership matches Wasps remain eighth like Bath losers in the weekend race for a Heineken Cup spot They are now three points behind Exeter in sixth spot with Bath sandwiched between them Leicester are not yet guaranteed a home semi final but with Bath to visit before a final game at home to London Irish it is in touching distance Cockerill clearly thought so when he rested Geoff Parling Tom Croft and Tom Youngs all of whom trained on Saturday But after all the energy and passion expended in a losing European cause at Toulon last weekend the game took a while getting started the first quarter a colourless affair marked only by a couple of Toby Flood penalties and one or two breaks from Anthony Allen that suggested the Wasps midfield might not be as secure as the Bank of England Then from the second scrum of the game the Leicester pack got up their first head of steam Manu Tuilagi took the Allen route through the middle and the hooker Rob Hawkins came within a whisker before Youngs dived through a hole conveniently close to the ruck Flood missed the conversion but Leicester were under way and next it was the forwards who took their reward for previous hard work Niall Morris Allen and the backs took the ball up the right and when the switch came it was the back row pair of Jordan Crane and Steve Mafi who worked the second row Graham Kitchener into the corner Again Flood missed the kick as he had done a couple of penalties but with the fly half Nicky Robinson and high scoring wing Christian Wade already back in the Wasps sick bay things were starting to look ominous The replacement Tommy Bell landed a wind assisted penalty to make it 16 3 but then the video referee took an age denying Thompstone a third Leicester try after some deft work from Hawkins and the wing Morris looked to be heading for the right corner until the Wasps lock James Cannon hauled him down Twice denied Leicester took a more certain route the driven lineout Mafi taking the ball at the front before the pack crowded round to rumble over the Wasps line at a canter Hawkins came up with the ball some reward for earlier close shaves Again Flood missed the conversion but with Young s side unable to hang on to the ball the England fly half s kicking hardly looked like undermining the outcome and four minutes into the second half a game that had been over for a while as a contest was put to bed with Leicester s bonus point try We couldn t handle the physicality the Tigers brought to the game We were well beaten Young said You don t have to be a rugby expert to know we have to improve The top three or four are in a different place from where we are Even when we were in fourth place I said I didn t think we had the squad to maintain that Leicester Tait Morris Tuilagi Allen Thompstone Flood capt Ford 69 B Youngs Harrison 45 Mulipola Balmain

bat again and despite Gary Ballance reaching a half century with a reverse sweep off Monty Panesar their resistance was brief With the new ball Chris Jordan had Jack Brooks caught by Mike Yardy at second slip and just two balls later Steve Magoffin wrapped up the match and claimed his fifth wicket of the innings as Ballance was caught behind Sussex batted and bowled better than we did and when that happens you tend to go down so it was very disappointing Gillespie said after his side s first game back in Division One To get bowled out for 96 in the first innings was unacceptable and we recognise that fact The batsmen have put their hands up and said that it was not good enough It is too early to draw any conclusions and we knew that the standard of cricket was going to be challenging in the First Division but we were not up to it here Middlesex trounced Nottinghamshire by 10 wickets at Trent Bridge where openers Chris Rogers and Sam Robson chased down a potentially tricky victory target of 108 in just 25 overs Sussex close in despite Ballance defiance Sussex turn the screw Nightmare start for Yorkshire at Headingley Middlesex were the better team But the thing that disappoints me is they beat us playing the sort of cricket we usually play They did the basics well said Notts director of cricket Mick Newell Durham who ended last season strongly under new captain Paul Collingwood began the new one with a 48 run win over Somerset at Chester le Street Craig Kieswetter attempted to hold Somerset together with a 135 ball 72 but found little support and Graham Onions and Ben Stokes who shared six wickets between them prospered in helpful conditions Defending champions Warwickshire were again frustrated by rain which restricted play to just two hours against Derbyshire at Edgbaston That was just enough time for each side to collect a bonus point Essex batsman Tom Westley made the most of a day s practice in the rain wrecked match against Gloucestershire at Chelmsford by batting more than six hours for his 163 his second first class century of the season", "The in form second rower Liam Farrell scored a first half hat trick of tries as the Super League leaders Wigan pricked Bradford s bubble by cruising to a 36 6 victory at Odsal Bradford s coach Francis Cummins had dubbed the game a yardstick to measure his team s play off prospects after an encouraging start to the season and will be acutely aware of the size of the task after suffering a first defeat in four matches in such emphatic fashion Bradford s disappointment ought to be tempered by the fact that few teams could have lived with Wigan in this form especially in the first half as they consolidated their lead at the top of the table with a fifth straight win The victory stroll came a fortnight after Wigan s Super League record 84 6 win at Hull KR The Wigan full back Sam Tomkins took over as Super League s leading tryscorer with his 14th of the season but it was Farrell who must have caught the eye of the Parramatta recruitment manager Peter Nolan who was reportedly at the game to watch Lee Mossop before finalising a deal for the 24 year old prop and his England team mate Gareth Hock The boot of Brett Hodgson put a spirited Wakefield to bed as his 76th minute drop goal got Warrington over the line with a 41 34 win Tony Smith s Wolves had led 24 6 and 40 22 at the Rapid Solicitors Stadium but the home side refused to lie down and came back to within six points as the clock showed five minutes left A catalogue of errors then let them down though with the double tryscorer Paul Sykes not finding touch with a penalty and then Kyle Amor giving away a penalty setting up Hodgson for his nerve settling contribution It was perhaps rough justice on Wakefield but Warrington simply reaped the benefit of outscoring their hosts seven tries to six with Ryan Atkins Joel Monaghan and Stefan Ratchford all getting braces Huddersfield s hooker Shaun Lunt scored two and made another in an eight try romp as the Giants won a third successive match 50 30 at home to Hull KR Lunt a Grand Final winner on loan with Leeds last term created the opening for Craig Kopczak to dive over just nine minutes into an entertaining contest The 25 year old then dashed 50m after Brett Ferres and Scott Grix combined to send him clear for a solo touchdown in the 21st minute His second came on 68 minutes at a crucial time as the game was balanced at 32 24 to the Giants and involved a move which Lunt started and finished himself", "On Saturday night millions of people around the world took to the first tee at Augusta for the final round of the Masters And then they woke up But there is a man who gets to live out the dream shared by all those hapless hackers His name is Jeff Knox and for the last decade he has been Augusta National s official marker That means when the field is one short as it has been after the cut this year he makes up the numbers On Saturday he played with the defending Masters champion Bubba Watson and on Sunday he was paired with the 2011 PGA champion Keegan Bradley You might imagine that as a 50 year old amateur Knox would come off poorly in that kind of company You wouldn t be the first to be fooled into thinking that Given that he is representing Augusta National it wouldn t do In 2006 Knox played the final round with Sergio Garc a Whisper this because the members wouldn t look to kindly on such a tale getting around but the two of them are reputed to have put a little something on the side just to make things interesting Knox s scores don t count after all and Garc a had blown up the previous day and was nine shots off the lead I remember seeing them all come down the fairway on the 18th Sergio had just sent his drive way over into the trees one long time Masters spectator says And Jeff and his caddie had these big old grins on their faces The story goes that Garc a refused to shake Knox s hand when the round was over Yeah I played pretty good against Sergio Knox said afterwards with an understandable hint of self satisfaction He made par which was one better than Garc a managed The Spaniard should have known better Knox holds the course record around Augusta National a 61 which he shot back in 2002 That was off the members tees which are a lot more forgiving than the ones used during Masters week Off those Knox s best score is a mere 69 The Knox family draw a lot of water in Augusta and not just because of Jeff s golf game His father Boone was also a club member He was a handy player himself once entering the British Amateur Championship but he spent most of his time building his business empire It got big enough to allow him to make a 2m 1 3m endowment to Augusta State University in 2008 and pay for the Salvation Army centre downtown With that kind of legacy behind him Knox surely has plenty of time to practice He s reckoned to be the best amateur golfer in Augusta though he finished runner up to his own son Lee at last year s state championships They say Knox s win loss record against his playing partners in the Masters is a little better than 50 50 It helps of course that he doesn t have to deal with the pressure of trying to make his way up the leaderboard But then you have to balance that against the fact he s playing in front of a crowd of 30 000 people Jim Furyk played one round with Knox back in 2006 and told the press afterwards that he reckoned he could beat half the field who made the cut Knox first got the call to play back in 2003 when he was paired twice with the 1982 champion Craig Stadler He beat him both times around In 2006 he outdrove Miguel ngel Jiminez on the first tee Jiminez turned to him with a grin wagged his finger and warned Don t you dare outdrive me Knox couldn t help himself He did it again at the 10th And last year he licked the US Amateur champion Kelly Kraft by two strokes 75 to 77 Knox was at it again on Saturday giving Watson a free lesson in how to play Amen Corner At the 11th he played a deft approach and made two tidy putts to set up a par while Watson dumped his second shot into the water clumped a chip onto the edge of the green and ended up with a double bogey Then at the 12th the hardest hole in tournament golf as Jack Nicklaus calls it Knox knocked his tee shot to eight feet of thre hole and rolled in the putt for a birdie That was kind of neat he said afterwards In front of that huge crowd I couldn t feel my knees You d never know it He has an easy air on the course as if he s a little amused by how hard a time his partners are having On the 5th yesterday he stood leaning on his putter one hand in pocket while Bradley was trying to figure the best way out of the mess he d made for himself when he hit his second into the grandstand Knox of course had rolled his own approach right on to the fringe of the green No one wants to play with me very much Knox said with a grin when his round was over because that means they re in last place That may be true but it s not theonly reason", "By Gareth A Davies MMA Correspondent 1 30PM BST 14 Apr 2013 Comments The first women s MMA fight

they can haul back the two goal advantage given their opponents by the striker Conny Pohlers and the left winger Martina Muller according to their manager Shelley Kerr The Gunners without their injured England star Kelly Smith were on top for spells of the first leg and Ellen White might have hit a hat trick with better fortune the striker having two goalbound efforts cleared off the line and bouncing a header off the crossbar We created three or four good chances said Kerr but we can play better It s a big ask now to get the goals we need but this team has shown in the past that they can score away from home and we ll go into the second leg believing we can get through to the final Kerr s opposite number Ralf Kellermann will be taking nothing for granted We started well he said but when we scored our late second goal our backs were against the wall and in the end we were a bit fortunate Wolfsburg are in their first European campaign while Arsenal are in their 11th but that statistic belies the German team s current standing They have no silverware to their name since being formed in 2003 but an expensive recruitment campaign resulting in a starting lineup containing nine internationals has seen them take over the mantle of Potsdam whom Arsenal beat in the Champions League quarter final as Germany s top female side They had the better of the early stages at Borehamwood but Arsenal recovered well to produce some telling pressure the right winger Gemma Davison and the midfielder Kim Little both going close The home side went behind however when the former Potsdam striker Pohlers volleyed home the right winger Anna Blasse s 29th minute cross Arsenal were almost level six minutes later White having her close range shot hacked clear by the right back Luisa Wensing Arsenal pressed either side of half time and White again went desperately close to equalising in the 72nd minute heading against the bar after Little s powerful drive had deflected off a defender Three minutes later White was denied again by Wensing the full back this time clearing a header off the line But then what may prove the killer blow arrived five minutes from time Muller

FA Cup semi final which pits big spending Chelsea and even bigger spending Manchester City in a fight for the right to play Wigan Both sides have struggled to meet the lofty ambitions of their supporters this season but a win at a sunny Wembley and a further visit for the final next month could really brighten up their season City who are yet to concede in this competition this season have swept all before them playing with an authority that suggests they will be very very keen on a win this afternoon But Chelsea have one thing massively in their favour pedigree They have lifted the trophy four times in the last six years and excluding penalty shoot outs are unbeaten in their last 29 FA Cup matches winning 23 and drawing six Form versus pedigree Who will prevail Let s find out But before we do let s read the below preview Match Notes Chelsea despite all the glum faces around Stamford Bridge are still on course for two trophies following their passage to the Europa League semi final and a clash with Basle Their record in the FA Cup is second to none at least in recent years but they must overcome the 2011 winners and a club still buzzing from their Old Trafford triumph

Cup game when Carlos T vez has played The City striker has featured in 11 and City have won 10 and drawn one John Ley s prediction Chelsea 1 Manchester City 2", "Paolo Di Canio described Sunderland s 3 0 victory over Newcastle as the best result of his managerial career to date and the Italian revealed he had a premonition of the win that came one year after the death of his mother Di Canio who celebrated all three goals with unbridled joy during a memorable north east derby has endured a difficult fortnight since his controversial appointment on Wearside but there was a sense of vindication as he dived on his knees along the touchline and gestured up to the Sunderland board After shaking hands with a dejected Alan Pardew Di Canio went over to applaud the travelling fans high in the Leazes End who had sung his name throughout the match However following the passing of his mother Pierina Di Canio believes there were greater forces at work Before the kick off I believed in this he said I believed in this thing Before kick off I saw the face of my mother smiling Exactly yesterday is one year since she passed away this is not an accident I believe in something some energy You may think maybe I m mad A year ago it was the same situation I was in the dugout the day after she passed away and we won the game at Swindon I have to thank not only my mother but also my dad as well or he is going to be upset up there Di Canio continued I can t forget that I was manager of Swindon I won the league and won many important games in the cup But when you arrive at the top and you win one of the hottest derbies in the world as a single game it is the most important for me But it is nothing if we don t stay up It was Sunderland s first three points at St James Park since their 2 1 victory in 2000 Niall Quinn scored the winner on that occasion and was quick on Sunday to praise the club s board after a result that puts them only two points behind Newcastle in the table The Sunderland board took some stick for the appointment said Quinn Their idea was to bring some sparkle to the club and boy has he done that Di Canio described the derby occasion in general as beautiful but has asked the fans to aim their praise towards the players in future rather than sing songs about him They have to sing the players names not because I want to be a humble person I understand when they sing the manager s name it is about the group but they have to sing the players names because the players work so hard They were warriors today he said But my fans have to put my players name in the frame because they were heroes they did a fantastic job We know about the rivalry in this area but it was important to get the three points The rivalry in this area is famous around the world so to get the three points away from home at Newcastle is fantastic I feel a high responsibility for this club because you all know what happened last week I have to deliver to the board the best job as a professional and as a man to make them proud and let them understand they have made the best decision", "The Football Association may change the way high risk matches at Wembley are policed as part of the ongoing inquest into the serious unrest among Millwall fans that marred Saturday s FA Cup semi final against Wigan Athletic The FA general secretary Alex Horne said the scenes of bloody violence in the Millwall end unlikely to have been the image the FA wanted to project to the world in a week when it claimed the competition had been fully revived were deplorable He vowed to work with police to review the events which resulted in 14 people being arrested 12 Millwall fans and two Wigan fans including six for affray Police said there would be a significant post match review to identify any further offenders But while it may reasonably argue that no one could have predicted that the Millwall fans would turn on each other the FA will also face questions of its own over the kick off time and the apparent delay in police officers arriving on the scene as the situation smouldered for over half an hour during the second half The Millwall Supporters Club whose secretary Graeme Smale said he was devastated that the actions of a small minority had again blighted the club also raised questions over the 5 15pm kick off time and the number of drunken fans present The kick off time for the semi final was lauded by Horne earlier this week because it increased television audiences But according to Smale it also vastly increased the number of inebriated fans Some of these people go to the pub at 10am and get blind drunk What are they doing in the ground he said As behaviour within football grounds has improved over the past two decades stewards have tended to replace police officers But the stewards who are not trained security guards are told to hang back if an incident escalates into a public order offence So while they may deal with persistent standing or obscene language they will be ordered to stand back and wait for the police if violence is involved Given the endless images of the 1980s that have filled screens and newspapers since the death of the former prime minister Margaret Thatcher was announced on Monday it was tempting to view scenes of fans exchanging blows and causing serious injury as of another era But for all the club s attempts to overhaul its image and drive out the elements of its fanbase that have damaged its reputation down the years with measures ranging from its impressive community schemes and charitable trust to practical steps like membership schemes and banning orders their efforts have been undermined While a long way from the dark days of the 1980s most infamously the riot involving Millwall fans at Luton s Kenilworth Road that led to Thatcher s ID card proposals periodic outbreaks of violence and disorder have continued to blight the club since particularly for high profile clashes against bitter rivals In 2009 there were running battles inside and outside Upton Park before and during a League Cup tie between West Ham and Millwall that prompted a similar bout of soul searching over what more the club could do to rid itself of the sizeable minority who revel in a reputation for violence It may have to be more condemnatory in its public statements than the tone suggested by its American chairman John Berylson a former US marine turned venture capitalist estimated to have pumped more than 16m into the club There are always a few idiots That s not our fan base and we don t even know who those people are We will be investigating said Berylson Although he also referred to them as a mindless minority the chief executive Andy Ambler was more explicit Our position is clear Anyone associated with our club found guilty of violent behaviour will be banned indefinitely from Millwall matches in addition to any punishment they receive from the authorities he said Yesterday the sports minister Hugh Robertson added The scenes in the Millwall end yesterday at Wembley involving a minority of so called fans were deplorable The perpetrators have absolutely no place in the game It is right that the Metropolitan Police and the FA are conducting a full investigation I also welcome Millwall Football Club s position that anyone found guilty of violent behaviour will be banned indefinitely from Millwall matches Millwall fans many of whom were booing those involved in the trouble have since been caught in the familiar bind of trying to condemn the perpetrators while defending their club from the inevitable onslaught of criticism I m devastated by it These idiots have used us as a convenient vehicle We want to get rid of these individuals who have to take responsibility for their own actions They are no good to us whatsoever said Smale who said Millwall were doing everything possible to shake off a rogue element which attached itself to the club for big matches but rarely went to regular League games These people treat Millwall like an old fag packet he added They want to misbehave They are there for a reason they are nothing to do with the football club Coupled with the result it certainly took the sheen off what should have been a memorable day at Wembley for the club No players want that to happen said Millwall s captain Danny Shittu It was supposed to be a happy day regardless of the result it was meant to be good day out at Wembley I m disappointed by it but as players we just have to keep doing what we do At the end so many supporters showed they were there just to spur us on but it s disappointing to hear about such things happening on a day like that It s a small minority but things like that should not be happening It should have been a great day for both sides It should have been the biggest day of young defender Shane Lowry s life The 23 year old Australian said Sometimes you get a minority but we brought almost 32 000 fans and the majority were fantastic They outsung the Wigan fans and backed us throughout the whole game It s disappointing to see incidents like that but the majority of fans have been fantastic this season While the majority of the 31 500 tickets allocated to Millwall fans were sold to season ticket holders who were each allowed to buy two extra tickets and members who were allowed to buy one additional ticket a small number are believed to have gone on general sale", "By Paul Bolton 2 00PM BST 14 Apr 2013 Comments Doncaster s relegation will be confirmed if they fail to beat

s and he had to drain a 20 footer for it as well Quite the affair But nothing compared to the 13 ran up by Tom Weiskopf in 1980 which we recounted in this old Joy of Six The Masters For those who can t be bothered to click this is what we said Spoiler alert the finale to Tin Cup right here Sort of Tom Weiskopf is along with poor old Greg one of the Masters foremost nearly men Between 1969 and 1975 he finished runner up four times and tied for sixth once He never did win the thing But even worse his remarkable consistency round Augusta he also finished in ninth tenth and 14th place during the 1970s is all but forgotten thanks to one meltdown in 1980 Weiskopf 6ft 3in tall was prone to hot funks which earned him the nickname of sheer brilliance this the Towering Inferno And he caught fire during the first round at Augusta in 1980 after dumping his tee shot into the water at the par three 12th He had been going reasonably well up to that point and so tried to knock his wedge from the dropping area dead Problem was the pin was in a tricky position near the front Weiskopf couldn t hold the green and the ball dropped into the drink again Instead of taking his medicine and aiming for the safer meatier part of the green Weiskopf on full boil though all this was internalised he wasn t a club thrower decided he wasn t going to let this problem get the better of him And so he attempted to knock the ball stone dead again And again And again Three more times he found water before finally giving up and doing what he should have done in the first place playing safe and taking two putts Weiskopf had run up a score of 13 on the shortest hole on the course a tied record for the highest score on a single hole in Masters history though Tommy Nakajima s 1978 disaster was at least on the par five 13th He ended with an 85 the other 17 holes played in three over par 8 35pm BST Olesen would be leading Snedeker by two shots now actually because the easy going American has just missed a ten foot par effort on 4 There are bigger crimes than bogeying that hole but he s back to 7 leaving Day and Cabrera alone at 8 8 33pm BST Thorbjorn Olesen then What a performance this is by the young Dane Since the 12th hole yesterday he s 7 If he d managed to get round in level par on the opening day instead of the 78 he took he d be leading Day Cabrera and Snedeker now by one of the Golf Strokes Given that the 78 was his first ever competitive round at Augusta you can conclude that the guy s one hell of a quick learner A future Green Jacket winner Don t bet against it Updated at 8 35pm BST 8 29pm BST Tiger shakes off his funk and lands his tee shot at six virtually in the hole Snedeker responds on four by slapping his into the bunker And with that I ll hand you back to Scott Murray who has got his Masters jive on and is ready to dance 8 26pm BST Thorbjorn Olesen s making things interesting He s 3 for the tournament and the day having picked up three shots on his way out

he knocks it to within two inches A beauty marred only by the fact it fails to clonk clonk into the cup He knocks it in for birdie to go to 8 and into a share of the lead Snedeker chips onto the green

young kid with a few technical deficiencies but over the course of a round I was able not only to iron out his technique but also cure his social reticence with a lively debate on the pursuance of detente as an international disarmament strategy 8 01pm BST Westwood finds the right line at 5 but it doesn t have the guts Still he cards a par four there which is nothing to be ashamed of He s 3 for

there He rolls a very nasty par putt in to stay at 3 for the day There s a little rain coming down now well Snedeker s got his brolly up anyway 7 56pm BST Tiger sends his putt at the third slowly slowly slowly towards the hole He doesn t quite hit it hard enough though and it drifts right and misses He taps in for par still looking disgusted Snedeker hammers a nice tee shot on the second but Cabrera continues his harem skarem round just missing the bunker off the tee but getting a massive kick off the back of it to send his ball skittering down the fairway His round could well be the most entertaining of the day 7 52pm BST But Day s not our leader for long Not our sole leader anyway Snedeker has birdied the first to go to 8 too Cabrera s got himself back into things with a good pitch into the first green but has a tricky little putt to rescue par which he makes after a rollercoaster opening to his round He s on his own at 7 now 7 49pm BST Ho Here we go Jason Day has just chipped in from the bunker at the second He birdied the first with a brilliant putt and eagled the second He s our new leader at 8 Meanwhile Cabrera s not happy with his recovery from downtown on the first

69 anyway about the 16th after a grizly previous hole he was attempting polte conversation and asked what i did for a living I informed him that i didn t work and that i was distracted by an Assault

6 He double bogeyed 4 but several miles from the pin on 6 he hammered his putt way too hard all the way up the green and into the hole He looks a little embarrassed about that one but needn t be they all count That s a birdie for him Tiger knocks in for par at 2 and looks like he s got an unholy funk on about the way this round has started John Huh would make a good playing partner for Kevin Na

somewhere in some bushes his ball in the brush He hoicks the ball out and lets it roll down the fairway That was about the best he could do from there and it wasn t half bad Meanwhile Kuchar s bunker

round He s now 5 on his way up the last having knocked in six birdies and a bogey so far Tiger s knocked his tee shot on the second way down the left into unpleasantsville He mutters Get lucky under

with an eagle shout there 7 13pm BST Tim and Tiger are on the first tee Tim Clark goes first weebling one up the middle of the fairway Tiger s in red with The Look on his face It slides off it almost immediately as his tee shot slides off the fairway and onto the longer stuff He s not in terrible shape from there though 7 10pm BST Figuring he may as well keep everyone chuckling Na has just lobbed his iron approach into the 13th green into the water again His caddie could keep everyone rolling in the aisles at this point simply by pulling out a pair of galoshes Here s hoping Updated at 7 10pm BST 7 07pm BST Evening everyone Some glorious news to bring you as I take over for a bit Kevin Na the man with the most can t be bothered name in golf has just take a 10 at the par 3 12th A 10 He knocked his tee shot into the drink with delightful insouciance then his second and then his third Top work Then when finally somewhere near dry land he then splodged his chip into some filth Finally he rattles the thing in for a 10 waves his cap and is laughed at by the entire gallery He s 16 12 for the day Oof 7 00pm BST Some gentle oscillations at the bottom end of the red section of the leaderboard That doesn t really mean anything does it What I m trying to say is Zach Johnson Justin Rose and Thorbjorn Olesen have all picked up an early shot and they re now under par Specifically 1 Sergio Garcia having played the first has not and is already running out of chances to shoot this 62 I d like to see Bah I m in need of some comfort food so to this end I ll hand you over to the man I m calling Tea Time Tee Time Tommy but you ll know better as Tom Bryant Off to have a big bowl of Hamburger Helper still the only food stuff to be marketed by a talking golf glove Now with added flavor 6 53pm BST Michael Thompson makes it home without any drama and signs for a best of day 67 He ends the tournament at 2 ruing that third round 79 Will David Toms better it I wonder He s just picked up another birdie this time at 14 and is currently 4 for the day with four still to play offering birdie chances aplenty Yeah fourteen sighs Simon McMahon as he watches Tianlang Guan heelclick off over the horizon When I was fourteen I was a dysfunctional misfit with no mates sitting in my bedroom listening to The Smiths writing bad poetry and playing Manic Miner on the ZX Spectrum Still look at me now eh You ve got the Smiths on your iPod you ve downloaded a ZX Spectrum emulator and you re sending blank verse to national newspaper websites via electronic mail Progress doesn t necessarily mean we ve gone forward does it 6 48pm BST Rory latest incorporating Inevitable Hole In One at 16 latest Unless something strange and unlikely happens down 17 and 18 young Mr McIlroy is going to be leaving Augusta feeling better than he ll have done for most of the week He s made it through Amen Corner without fuss meltdown or dropping any shots That ll give him succour for next year Furthermore he s now 3 for the day having birdied 15 then come within one roll of an ace at 16 He walks down the hole on his way to tapping in for his second birdie on the bounce wearing a huge smile A Green Jacket here one day Hell yes 6 42pm BST The first move of the day from a player who started the final round in red figures It s come from Gonzalo Fernandez Castano who has birdied the opening hole to move to 2 Charl Schwartzel has reached level par with a birdie at 5 And David Toms is through 13 without a blemish on his scorecard having picked up shots at 7 8 and now 13 he s 3 for the day and 1 for the tournament There are shots out there there are shots out there Peter Hanson incidentally is the latest to come to within a dimple of an ace at 16 Strap yourselves in good people I predict an afternoon of Golf Shots 6 34pm BST Sandy Lyle incidentally finished with a one under 71 That s a brilliant end to the week for the old Master who only really showed his age during yesterday s testing conditions shooting 81 Otherwise he s level par for the week Hats off Sandy 6 33pm BST Fourteen years old though 6 31pm BST Tianlang Guan s great adventure is over It s ended with a 75 yet another magnificent scorecard with the young man s signature at the bottom of it Grown men have collapsed under the pressure of that arena begins Alistair Elder s tribute and keeping it together after the penalty shows something special about him Indeed it does He s been staunch in the face of blustering buffoonery and will be back here in years to come causing all sorts of bother at the top end of the leaderboard He can leave here proud of an amazing week s work in which he s defied all expectations by playing some amazing fearless golf and fielded all that s been thrown at him principally a hose of hot bullshit from the officials One hell of a spectacular journey stretches out in front of him God speed young man 6 24pm BST Round of the day so far though Michael Thompson may have something to say about this soon is 68 posted by Ryan Moore He d reached the turn in 33 then handed all his shots back at 10 and 11 with a double bogey at the latter But he made four birdies along the closing seven holes What does this suggest Berserk drama later on that s what it suggests for these closing holes are offering up plenty of birdie opportunities It s going to be a blast 6 18pm BST Peter Hanson will birdie 16 I know this because he s plonked his tee shot into the centre of the green sending the ball turning left down the hill and to within half an inch of the cup If that Yep there s going to be a hole in one here today it s the perfect set up for it 6 11pm BST Thompson is paired with Ishikawa and it s the match of the day so far Thompson has just sent his tee shot at 16 to a couple of feet for a certain birdie he ll go to 5 for the day 2 overall Ishikawa s tee shot looks positively hopeless by comparison he s only got his to 15 feet The Japanese youngster is playing brilliantly after a double bogey at the vicious 12th he s birdied 13 14 and 15 the last courtesy of a marvellous approach straight over the flag which only just toppled off the back of the green denying him an eagle putt Ishikawa can t quite roll in his birdie putt on 16 a brave effort dying right of the hole a turn too early but Thompson puts his away So what is all this proving That there s a score out there surely the chatter in the clubhouse suggests a 65 could be on offer for someone remember and that the 16th hole is begging for someone to ace it 6 03pm BST A few players up the top of the leaderboard will be hoping for a little bit of Michael Thompson s luck today He s going well in his final round 3 for the day thanks to a run of birdies at 8 12 and 13 Going for the green in two at 15 from the top of the hill he just about makes it but the ball topples back off the putting surface and down towards the drink before holding up on the slope gravity having buggered off to Butlin s He gets up and down for another birdie Last year s US Open runner up has had a pretty good Masters all told an opening day 73 followed by a 71 and now this Shame about being incapable of coping with yesterday s tough set up without a third round 79 he d be in a very healthy position indeed As it is 3 overall is nothing to be ashamed of on only his second visit to Augusta and his first since 2008 5 52pm BST Phil Mickelson s 2013 Masters in microcosm right here He s just dunked his tee shot at 16 into the drink Bogey This off the back of birdie at 9 bogey at 10 birdie at 12 bogey at 13 and 14 and birdie at 15 Thing is with Lefty though he usually takes it all in good grace and he lollops off the green wearing his trademark puppy dog grin 5 41pm BST Keegan Bradley the first man out today finishes his 2013 Masters with a birdie at 18 and signs for a 69 He s 9 for the tournament and the clubhouse leader Well he is 5 39pm BST Guan is playing alongside Sandy Lyle the 1988 winner and the man who hit the greatest bunker shot in the history of All Golf He s showing some of the old magic here He puts his approach at 15 straight through the back of the green down an almost impossible bank with little green to play with but he chips up and somehow gets the ball to bite right by the hole How did he get so much spin on that That s a birdie And then on 16 he sends his tee shot into the centre of the green his ball arcing round to the left and rolling down the slope to within four feet of the pin Magical Guan naturally learns from the old Master and replicates the shape of the shot the young lad s effort going to two feet Birdies for them both And I tell you what I wouldn t be surprised if there s a hole in one at 16 today it looks perfectly set up for plenty of players to take a run at it 5 35pm BST The Man tried to bundle Tianlang Guan onto a plane on Friday afternoon but the Golfing Gods were kind He squeaked inside the cut and here he is now coming down 15 on the final day of the Masters as a 14 year old It doesn t get any less amazing no matter how many times it s repeated does it His lay up before the water looks a wee bit overcooked but snags up in the second cut allowing him to send a gorgeous chip to six feet That s a beauty But he misses the short putt and for the first time in the entire week betrays his age a tad looking a bit upset at spurning such a golden opportunity for birdie He gets over it quickly enough perhaps remembering his birdie today two holes back on 13 his first since the final hole of that opening day round of 73 What a week He s 12 which doesn t sound much but is simply stunning really 5 23pm BST Knox couldn t make his birdie on 16 sadly but a par will do Bradley kicking along beside him had clipped his tee shot to six feet and rattled in the birdie putt It was his third in a row a run which sees him 2 for the day and 10 overall When I first heard about the Tiger thing I couldn t understand the problem as I assumed he had the right to go back as far as he wanted admits Kevin Mannerings The point is that the ball went into the water on a different line to when it first crossed the hazard as it deflected after hitting the pin But could Tiger have even known that It is the most natural thing to assume the line is where it crosses the water edge after you hit it as 99 99 of the time that is the right answer Only in freak cases where it bounces in from a deflection is it wrong So if Tiger had gone straight in the water the drop would have been fine Some reasoned debate there from a respectable member of our intelligent readership something which could be said to stand in stark contrast to this offering from Simon Farnaby Garcia has a ballsack full of omelette So soft 5 15pm BST There was quite a bit of cynical and downright sniffy chat ahead of this tournament regarding the invitation extended to Ryo Ishikawa Good to see then that the Japanese youngster has proved his worth this week He was in the mix on the opening day with a round of 71 and while his subsequent cards of 77 and 76 weren t much to write home about he s come with his A game today birdies at 1 9 and now 10 have moved him up to a very respectable 5 for the tournament At 3 through 11 his is the best score of the day as things stand Updated at 5 31pm BST 5 08pm BST Keegan Bradley s playing partner today incidentally is a chap called Jefferson Knox Wasn t he played by Burt Lancaster in Local Hero Anyway he s the 2011 PGA champion s marker and seems like a pleasant enough chap He s just missed a tiddler on 15 but has walked off the green with a broad smile nonetheless He s done this a few times before by all accounts I m not a very popular chap to play with he s apparently admitted though this is the set up for a gag about his partner always by definition being rock bottom of the field The gentle golf humour you see Anyway he s just clattered his tee shot at 16 to eight feet so we re in no position to scoff at this dude 5 00pm BST Weather report It s going to stay dry probably a 20 chance of rain they re saying and it ll be warm if a bit overcast Fingers are crossed for a bit of Masters sun come the denouement While giving out this information the good folk at CBS Television also reported that the chatter in the clubhouse among the pros is that there s a 65 out there today You don t get that sort of hot chat from the BBC forecast 4 44pm BST It wouldn t be Masters Sunday without a charge from Lefty Unfortunately for everyone he s left it way too late having followed his opening round of 71 with dismal cards of 76 and 77 Still here s hoping for a blitz of red numbers today he s birdied 4 and now 9 to go out in 34 though he s back at 7 and sadly a complete irrelevance Mind you it ll be interesting to see how he copes with Amen Corner today because he dropped three shots there on Friday and another four yesterday And hello he s warming up for it nicely in the purely slapstick sense because he s just shipped his first bogey of the round at 10 Oh Phil Updated at 5 30pm BST 4 37pm BST Whether the course is going to offer up shots today remains to be seen there was some reasonable early scoring yesterday before Augusta National bared its teeth but Ryan Moore has gone out in a blemish free 33 strokes birdies at 3 7 and 8 He s 5 for the tournament There ll be plenty of players up at the business end who will be dreaming of a front nine like that 4 23pm BST Ah he s just bogeyed 4 Still the toughest par three on the course and the thought was there 4 22pm BST Spare a thought for Guardian and Observer wordsmith poet and general all round Renaissance Man Andy Bull who was last seen being chased down Magnolia Drive yesterday by a 16 foot pink furry imaginary cockroach one of the many now living in his head after a week staying at the 69th best motel in Augusta of 79 Chances are he s rocking metronomically on a porch chair somewhere sobbing grasping an empty six pack to his chest and jabbering about what he found one morning in his sink but thankfully one of the hotel roaches has in his absence commandeered his laptop and has been filing some cracking stuff This piece on the travails of poor young Rory McIlroy is worth a long look Rory shot a painful 79 yesterday a round which included a triple bogey meltdown on 11 It was more Amen Corner pain for the young man who has worn a haunted look around Augusta ever since that final day 80 two years ago The scars of that day suggests the roach under Bull s byline are taking a while to heal perhaps understandably So it s to be hoped that with Rory out of contention this year he uses his final round today to shake off a few demons formulate a couple of plans for 2014 and regain a wee bit of confidence Let s hope that rebuilding process is underway he s birdied the 2nd and is 1 for the day through 3 Updated at 5 28pm BST 3 46pm BST Horton Who Ah Here Bubba Watson made off with a few quid shy of 940 000 last year plus a Green Jacket of course and this year s victor will be scampering off clutching a similar sized sack of loot in his sweaty paw while chucking tee hee guffaw now for a feast and suchlike But spare a thought for the first ever winner of the Masters Tournament back in 1934 Horton Smith who only trousered 1 500 for his troubles And even then he had to wait until a few club members chipped into the tournament purse for Augusta National itself didn t have two bawbees to rub together at the time Here s Horton gadding around Pinehurst in nearby North Cakalaka teaching losers various how to play good golf It s worth watching every minute of this the tips are great obviously but the tinder dry voiceover is a scream Not sure who my favourite hapless golfer featured in this moving picture is the woman who is stymied behind a tree and considering committing soccer or Clifford the hapless quack who took up golf for his health and is about to give it up for the same reason We join him at the tail end of a round of 304 strokes and two of those were apoplectic Playing the 18th Clifford puts his ball through the window of the 19th and has to go inside to fetch it He d go to his locker happier if he hadn t found that some of his equipment had preceded him Enjoy 3 27pm BST Here s the top of the leaderboard after three rounds 7 Snedeker Cabrera 6 Scott 5 Leishman Day 4 Kuchar 3 Clark Woods 2 Fowler Stricker Langer Westwood Furyk 1 Watney Van Pelt Fernandez Castano Garcia Costanza 2 26pm BST The 77th Masters Tournament owes us a little something today Boil the bones down and yesterday s third round was a thoroughly miserable affair bookended by two experiences which crushed the soul in different ways The day started with Tiger s Trauma an undignified business all round not least in the gleeful stampede to finger the greatest player of the modern era as nothing more than a two bit cheat when confusing the drop at same spot rule with the drop along line where ball entered hazard option is an easy enough mistake to make at the best of times never mind when your almost perfect wedge has just twanged off the flag and into the blue vagueness in the heat of Masters action The day ended with a Couples Catastrophe the smoothest swinger in town keeping the fairytale alive through 13 holes then capitulating over the final five to extinguish the dream Butch Harmon s sullen reaction on Sky to seeing his erstwhile pupil suffer as he stumbled up the 18th in the wake of a triple bogey on 17 Freddie s just run out of gas he sighed wistfully was laced with heartbreak and the unconscious existential realisation that the 53 year old s fate served as an allegory of all humankind s inexorable decay and inevitable return to dust Better days We ve had them As for the bit in the middle Saturday is often referred to as Moving Day although with Augusta National finally baring its teeth yesterday there wasn t a whole lot of movin never mind shakin going on The main movers and responsible for the lion s share of excitement on a day overshadowed by Tigergate were Angel Cabrera Brandt Snedeker Adam Scott Matt Kuchar and Tim Clark the first four posting 69s to consolidate their positions at the top of the leaderboard Clark shooting a blistering best of day 67 to haul himself into the frame But Never mind For today promises to be a classic Could we wish for a better leaderboard going into the final round of the Masters The third round leaders Cabrera and Snedeker are two of the most swashbuckling stars on tour Scott tucked in behind would be a popular and overdue winner after his travails at the Open last year Jason Day and Marc Leishman complete an antipodean triumvirate looking to do what the Greg Normans and Kel Nagles of this world never did and bring a Green Jacket back Down Under It is almost impossible to dislike the ever smiling Matt Kuchar who has been sniffing around the majors for some time now There s that man Tiger of course and the in form Clark could spring a surprise if he keeps his rickety short game together Could Lee Westwood finally step up in the final round of a major post a target and let nerves do their thing to those remaining out on the course And Sergio could shoot a course record 62 But in conclusion it s on Here are today s tee times 9 20am EST 2 20pm BST Keegan Bradley and a marker who s a member at Augusta
