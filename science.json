["Forensic scientists at the University of Abertay in Dundee have become the first in the UK to recover latent fingerprints from foods Only two other studies have ever reported recovering fingerprints from foods but the research was carried out in India and Slovenia Those studies both used chemical substances that are not routinely used in the UK The technique could prove useful to police forces and the justice system Recovering fingerprints from foodstuffs has proved problematic in the past and as such it is often overlooked as evidence However by modifying an existing technique that was initially designed to recover fingerprints from the sticky side of adhesive tape the team at Abertay said this need no longer be the case We ve shown for the first time that it really is possible to recover fingerprints from them something that was previously thought to be unachievable Dennis Gentles a former crime scene examiner and forensic scientist who has worked at Abertay University for the past 10 years said Although there are proven techniques to recover fingerprints from many different surfaces these days there are some surfaces that remain elusive such as feathers human skin and animal skin Foods such as fruits and vegetables used to be in that category because their surfaces vary so much not just in their colour and texture but in their porosity as well These factors made recovering fingerprints problematic because some techniques for example work on porous surfaces while others only work on non porous surfaces He added The fact that we ve managed to successfully recover prints from such difficult surfaces as foods is another step forward in the fight against crime It may not seem like much but a piece of fruit might just be the only surface that has been handled in a crime scene so developing a trusted and tested technique to recover fingerprints from such surfaces is something to be valued by crime scene examiners The two previous studies carried out in India and Slovenia involved chemicals which are not used in the UK Instead the team modified a substance known as Powder Suspension a thick tar like material and found that it produced a clear high quality mark on the smooth surfaced food items such as onions apples and tomatoes Mr Gentles said Although Powder Suspension was initially developed to recover prints from the sticky side of adhesive tape it s since been found to work on other surfaces so we wondered whether it would work on foods as this was something it hadn t been tested on before We found that it out performed all the other methods we tested Although there s still a considerable amount of research to do before we can recommend techniques for all types of foods we ve shown for the first time that it really is possible to recover fingerprints from them something that was previously thought to be unachievable The publication of the team s research in the forensic science journal Science Justice means that others will now be able to replicate their results", "It was a cocktail party of a decidedly muted and academic sort The session called Chemistry at the Bar proved popular with some of the 14 000 scientists at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in New Orleans itself the birthplace of some powerful concoctions And if you ve ever made a cocktail that puts you in league with them Making cocktails is something like chemistry at its simplest adding different ingredients together experimenting that s how they ve evolved over the years to become as popular as they have said Neil Da Costa of International Flavors and Fragrances Dr Da Costa came to present his work analysing the Hurricane a cocktail invented in New Orleans in the 1940s as a means to use up rum that publicans had to buy in order to get access to the more prized whiskey Cocktails tend to be a rich mix of chemical components not just the crucial molecule called ethanol but a great many flavour compounds and volatiles that contribute to aroma Just what spirits are made from though remains hidden said Jerry Zweigenbaum of Agilent Technologies They re not regulated as a food you don t see on the label what s in it all you see is the alcohol content he told the meeting Here in the US alcoholic beverages are regulated not by the Food and Drug Administration but by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms with markedly different labelling standards Dr Zweigenbaum s work analysed a number of store bought samples with widely ranging prices of the liqueur amaretto Historically it has the taste of bitter almond thanks to a molecule called amygdalin that was probably originally obtained from apricots But applying some serious analytical chemistry tools to modern examples Dr Zweigenbaum instead found a great deal of benzaldehyde artificial almond oil Across brands that spanned a factor of five in cost and two in alcohol content he also found a trend in sweetness Initially I thought that to make an inexpensive brand more appealing it would have more sugar but the analysis showed there was more sugar in the more expensive brands he said It s not just spirits that have chemists attention Even the humble beer presents a complex combination of chemical components We ve developed class prediction models so if you gave me an unknown beer I could say the hop used in this beer is East Kent and it was made in 2010 Christine Hughey of James Madison University worked with a Danish beer maker called Mikkeller whose brewmaster she said takes a very scientific approach to brewing He prepared a number of India pale ales each using just one hop variety Dr Hughey created molecular fingerprints of the resulting beers mapping out the masses of all the molecules within Surprisingly there were marked variations even among 2010 and 2011 versions of the same beer with the same hop making the technique almost forensic in its precision We can use these molecular fingerprints to determine the year of production to determine the source for authentication she told BBC News I think especially with the craft beer movement people want to know what they re drinking We ve developed class prediction models so if you gave me an unknown beer I could say the hop used in this beer is East Kent and it was made in 2010 Wine has perhaps the most established credentials as a lush mixture of flavours both delicate and bold mixtures of extraordinary variety if critiques are anything to go by Andreas Dunkel of the Technical University of Munich deconstructed the molecules present in a high value Italian wine finding some 82 taste active compounds that were responsible for the wine s distinctive taste But analysis has shown that just 35 of those compounds in varying proportions could be used to effectively reconstruct the taste of any one of the wines Mr Dunkel s team has studied It is not about artificially creating a given wine he said it is more about quality control and consistency If I know which tastants are really relevant for the final product I can start breeding studies to increase or decrease certain tastants in the plant or the fruit he told BBC News Later I can use these results to optimise my production technology controlling the ageing process in the barrel for example The most important thing for a producer of wine is to have a characteristic quality

of a Hangover The hangover is an astonishingly complex physiological phenomenon with dozens of symptoms and relatively little human trial data rats and a few undergraduates are the preferred model for much of the relevant research Regrettably although much is known about the chemistry of how the body processes alcohol and how that can have effects on everything from our digestion to our immune

such as mammoths has been linked to rising temperatures around 11 000 years ago But researchers were surprised to find a contrasting population boom for whales living off the coast of Britain Their study is also the first to discover that the ocean giants lived in the southern North Sea Dr Andy Foote from the Natural History Museum of Denmark based at the University of Copenhagen co authored the paper published in the journal Nature Communications Based on all previous studies using ancient DNA to estimate the population size it seems the trend was for cold adapted species either to go extinct or decline in numbers at the end of the Ice Age as the temperature increased said Dr Foote Which ice age beasts roamed Britain s tundra Meet ancient Britain s massive lawn mowers How did a Scottish cave yield surprising secrets But while the fate of now extinct land based Ice Age animals is well documented little has been known about how marine animals were affected by the rapid temperature warming Bowhead whales today are found in Arctic seas and rely on sea ice where they feed on tiny crustaceans The research team wanted to find out how the whales fared during the rapid climate change of the Pleistocene Holocene epoch transition when the essential sea ice retreated from their North Sea habitat Scientists analysed ancient DNA of partly fossilised whale remains found in waters between Britain and Holland and around Denmark and Sweden They were able to use the data to create a habitat prediction model and build a picture of the whales past movements and probability of survival On the move The study showed that bowhead whales shifted their range moving northwards to more suitable Arctic waters The retreat of the ice in that particular case actually opened up very large areas where you all of a sudden had these ideal habitat conditions for these Arctic species said Dr Kristin Kaschner research affiliate at the University of Freiburg Germany Explaining why these marine animals may have thrived at the end of the last Ice Age while many land mammals populations declined she added Most marine mammals are used to migrating very long distances anyway I think that s one of the things that worked in the whales favour that they were able to track their habitat And then that combined with the fact that the retreat of ice actually opened up habitat was really favourable for them Why do bowheads live to such a grand old age According to the model the area of suitable habitat for bowhead whales tripled during the transitional period and the species saw a significant population increase at the same time The results show that Ice Age bowhead whales can be genetically identified as belonging to the same population found in the Arctic today with lineages surviving from the late Pleistocene through to the current Holocene period Bowhead whales are thought to be the longest living mammal in the world with some individuals possibly even reaching up to 200 years of age But the north eastern Atlantic bowhead whale population has been under threat from intense whaling according to the researchers Their study also suggests that climate change today could present an additional threat to the whales The team estimates that the Arctic animals core suitable habitat could almost be halved by the end of the century potentially influencing future populations Join BBC Nature on Facebook and Twitter BBCNature", "One of the UK s rarest birds is being put at further risk by the cold spring the RSPB has said The bodies of eight underweight stone curlews have been discovered in fields in Norfolk Suffolk and Wiltshire over the past few days The birds are thought to have come from Africa and Spain but struggled to find enough food to survive Conservation director Martin Harper said it was a stark reminder of how fragile this species is The birds weighed about 300g 10oz compared to what is considered a healthy weight of 450g 15oz The RSPB said there were about 400 pairs of stone curlews in the UK Other birds have been affected by the cold weather At the end of March hundreds of dead birds including puffins were washed ashore after severe conditions in the North Sea The RSPB said it had also received reports of short eared owls and barn owls found dead after cold weather hampered their ability to hunt Mr Harper said We should be hearing the sound of chiffchaffs calling from the trees a classic sign that spring is here but that isn t the case Some may have stalled on their migration route while for others the severe lack of insect food available means they are conserving what little energy they have", "Worried mothers in China are going to great lengths to get their hands on imported milk causing retailers in the UK and

benefits in the era prior to regulation are being revealed Scientists reporting at the American Chemical Society meeting have examined the contents of dozens of century old remedies held at a US museum Some contained high levels of helpful elements such as iron or calcium while others contained arsenic or mercury The exact recipes are still to be determined by the ongoing project Mark Benvenuto of the University of Detroit Mercy was approached by staff of the Henry Ford Museum which houses a vast archive of patent medicines They were able to determine from the boxes what the materials were supposed to be and from old newspapers how much they cost and what they were suppposed to cure Dr Benvenuto told the meeting But they didn t know what the materials were actually composed of The team used a technique called X ray fluorescence to get a first glimpse of the medicines ingredient lists X ray fluorescence works by firing X rays at a sample whose constituent atoms absorb an amount of the rays energy and radiate the rest This fluorescence is a telltale sign of which atoms are present and a rough idea of how many there are The team found that a majority of the samples contained elements known to be helpful such as calcium iron and zinc Others contained large amounts of harmful elements such as lead arsenic and mercury It was very interesting to see what they did use what translated going back to Roman times what has been kept up as far as healthy or ways to heal said Andrew Diefenbach a collaborator on the research They were going off of what had been done for years With some like those with iron or calcium they would have helped but others were in my opinion more bogus he told the meeting But determining the intent of the person who mixed these nostrums Dr Benvenuto said was difficult Some of what we consider the bad stuff actually was used to cure certain diseases back then syphilis was cured by arsenic and mercury he told BBC News What we re looking at is a group of people who were getting towards what we now consider modern medicine they were taking the first steps I believe some were systematically going about trying to cure some disease or another but in that mix there was probably a huckster or two", "Changes to their surroundings can trigger rapid evolution in species as they adopt traits to help them survive in the new conditions a study shows Studying soil mites in a laboratory researchers found that the invertebrates age of maturity almost doubled in just 20 or so generations It had been assumed that evolutionary change only occurred over a much longer timescale The findings have been published in the journal Ecology Letters What this study shows for the first time is that evolution and ecology go hand in hand explained co author Tim Benton professor of population ecology at the University of Leeds UK The implicit assumption has always been from Darwin onwards that evolution works on long timescale and ecology works on short timescales The thinking was that if you squash a population or you change the environment then nothing will happen from an evolutionary point of view for generations and generations for centuries Running wild Prof Benton said that the soil mites experiment was set up to help shed light on whether the change in the size of harvested fish species such as North Atlantic cod was a result of an evolutionary change The advantage of what we have done is that we have got free running populations of organisms that do their own thing he told BBC News You cannot do those sort of experiment with large organisms that live in the wild The team sourced soil mites from four UK locations and housed them in 18 tests tubes in a laboratory Some of the populations were harvested as per a fisheries management approach juveniles were harvested from some tubes adults from others and other tubes we just left alone Prof Benton explained Then we just looked to see what happened to their genetics their life history and their population dynamics We were all rather surprised to see how quickly they evolved in ways that you would not necessarily would have thought possible The key result is that over the 20 or so generations their age of maturity almost doubled that is an evolutionary effect That means that if the population is squashed for any reason then the population take longer to grow back and so you have all sorts of longer term consequences it is not just a matter of what is happening to their life histories Prof Benton said that the findings also showed that people involved in population management schemes such as conserving endangered species etc would have to take into account evolutionary factors as well as ecological ones as the result of environmental change He said For example if you think about the challenges of climate change and nature reserves where do you put the reserves The way that animals move across the landscape their dispersal behaviour is likely to evolve as a result of climate change Do you put the nature reserves just 10 miles apart because that is how far the animals travel now but in 50 years time they might disperse five miles Prof Benton added that evolutionary change added an additional pressure to population management schemes namely that it was much more difficult to reverse than ecological change Once you have lost the genes and the species has evolved into something different then it is very difficult to go back to what they were before", "Listening to new music is rewarding for the brain a study suggests Using MRI scans a Canadian team of scientists found that areas in the reward centre of the brain became active when people heard a song for the first time The more the listener enjoyed what they were hearing the stronger the connections were in the region of the brain called the nucleus accumbens The study is published in the journal Science Dr Valorie Salimpoor from the Rotman Research Institute in Toronto told the BBC s Science in Action programme We know that the nucleus accumbens is involved with reward But music is abstract It s not like you are really hungry and you are about to get a piece of food and you are really excited about it because you are going to eat it or the same thing applies to sex or money that s when you would normally see activity in the nucleus accumbens But what s cool is that you re anticipating and getting excited over something entirely abstract and that s the next sound that is coming up New tunes To carry out the study which took place at the Montreal Neurological Institute at McGill University the scientists played 19 volunteers 60 excerpts of new music based on their musical preferences As they were listening to the 30 second long tracks they had to the opportunity to buy the ones they liked in a mocked up online music store All of this was carried out while the participants were lying in an MRI machine By analysing the scans the scientists found that the nucleus accumbens was lighting up and depending on the level of activity the researchers could predict whether the participant was likely to buy a song Dr Salimpoor said As they are listening to this music we can look at their brain activity and figure out how they are appreciating or enjoying this music before they even tell us anything And that s part of this new direction that neuroscience is going in trying to understand what people are thinking and inferring their thoughts and motivations and eventually their behaviour through their brain activity The researchers found that the nucleus accumbens was also interacting with another region of the brain called the auditory cortical stores This is an area that stores sound information based on music that people have been exposed to before This part of the brain will be unique for each individual because we ve all heard different music in the past explained Dr Salimpoor The researchers now want to find out how this drives our music tastes and whether our brain activity can explain why people are drawn to different styles of music You can hear more about

of spring at last forecast to start in some parts of Britain this weekend has been a mute reminder of how things might have been had Rachel Carson not written her devastating warning about the damage

arrival of migrant birds and the mass emergence of insects blossom and spring flowers say naturalists But the prolonged winter may also have exacted a terrible toll on wildlife with many birds animals and plants perishing after months of bitter winds limited food and repeated heavy snowfalls The main pulse of southern migrant birds such as swallows and housemartins should arrive this weekend said Matthew Oates a naturalist with the National Trust The winds are at last in the right direction There are reports of a lot of chiffchaffs in the Channel Islands They may be stuck there Late springs are not unusual but 2013 has been exceptional because of the unremitting cold This is stretching my experience said Oates Frogs have only just started turning up Even in 1996 they had done their thing by the end of March This is quite remarkable The insects still haven t got going but as soon as it warms up the midges and flies should be out The bigger insects still haven t started Some ornithologists fear that tens of thousands of migrant birds which feed on the wing off insects and usually reach Britain by the start of April may have arrived and died We re actually not sure where they all are said Grahame Madge of the RSPB Possibly many have already arrived and perished Or they may be hanging around waiting for the right conditions Migrant birds like swallows housemartins and willow warblers travel thousands of miles from sub Saharan Africa to get here and use up all their fuel When they arrive they are exhausted they have probably lost half their body weight and are right on the edge of survival If they arrive and there are no insects to feed on they are in big trouble We could be looking at a bleak picture Swallows should be here by now to the point where the casual observer sees them in parks But we re a long way from that The evidence is that some of these birds have arrived but perished Reports of 11 stone curlews found dead in Norfolk last week and others seen feeding on beaches suggest that many birds are now desperate for food The rare birds who number only around 400 pairs in Britain overwinter in Spain or North Africa and feed off spiders and other insects If the birds have any sense they will have waited for the weather patterns to shift They may take a cue from a few warm days We could get a mass arrival If this weekend coincides with a mass emergence of insects those that have arrived could be the lucky ones said Madge who advised people to continue putting out bird food in their gardens Other wildlife is said to be on a knife edge and

volcanic eruption which disrupted European flights also had a significant but short lived impact on ocean life a study shows Ash from the Eyjafjallajokull volcano deposited dissolved iron into the North Atlantic triggering a plankton bloom The authors said it was good fortune they were at sea at the time as it provided a unique opportunity to sample the ocean during a volcanic eruption The findings appear in the Geophysical Research Letters journal In April 2010 the eruption sent an ash plume several kilometres into the atmosphere causing ash to deposited across up to 570 000 sq km of the North Atlantic Ocean The five week volcanic activity was still ongoing when a team of researchers arrived in the Iceland Basin region aboard a research vessel Our study was unique in the sense that we were the first to undertake sampling at sea of volcanic ash deposition and the chemical and biological effects in the surface ocean explained lead author Eric Achterberg from the National Oceanography Centre Southampton UK In addition we were able to sample the ocean region again a few months after the eruption and observe the changes since the eruption The opportunity to sample during the eruption and also a couple of months after the event allowed us to obtain a unique insight into the effects of the ash deposition on the biology and chemistry of the Iceland Basin Iron deficiency Three years earlier the team had shown that the production of phytoplankton microscopic plants that form a key component of marine food chains was limited by the availability of dissolved iron which was essential for the tiny plants growth Prof Achterberg told BBC News what the in situ team was able to record Biological experiments showed that the volcanic ash released the iron that stimulated phytoplankton growth The effect of the volcanic ash inputs were nevertheless short lived as the extra iron supplied by the volcano resulted in rapid biological nitrate removal thereby causing nitrogen limitation of the phytoplankton population So while the additional dissolved iron triggered an earlier than usual phytoplankton bloom as the metal triggered growth in a greater number of phytoplankton cells the bloom was only 15 20 larger than normal because the growth was limited by the amount of available nitrogen another vital ingredient required for the organisms to develop As well as playing an important role in food chains phytoplankton also absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere Oceans are considered to be one of the planet major players in the global carbon cycle but the carbon uptake in the region where the eruption occurred has limited capacity The high latitude North Atlantic Ocean is a globally important ocean region as it is a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide and an area where deep water formation takes place Prof Achterberg observed A limit to the availability of iron in this region means that the ocean is less efficient in its uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide However during the bloom triggered by the ash deposits from the eruption the team recorded that it was a shortage of nitrogen that limited the size of the phytoplankton bloom and as a result the volume of carbon dioxide uptake Prof Achterberg concluded The 2010 Eyjafjallajokull eruption therefore resulted in a significant but short lived perturbation to the biogeochemistry of the Iceland Basin", "A bizarre sound made by a primate could help to reveal more about the origins of human speech a study suggests Scientists have found that the gelada a species that is closely related to the baboon makes a gurgling noise that shares features with human language They believe the monkey s call could be similar to the primitive noises that the evolutionary ancestors of humans once made The study is published in the journal Current Biology The lead author Dr Thore Bergman from the University of Michigan in the US said Geladas make vocalisations that have some speech like properties it s the first time that that has been shown in a non human primates The wobble The call of the gelada which is found in the highlands of Ethiopia sounds like a cross between a yodel and a baby s gurgle To create sounds of such complexity is unusual in the primate world Monkeys and apes in general can only make the most basic noises It has been a puzzle how language evolved in humans when this skill falls so short in our closest evolutionary relatives But now scientists believe the gelada could help to shed light on the earliest forms of speech Researchers analysed the monkey s unusual call which they call a wobble Last year a paper published in Current Biology proposed that while most primates lack the vocal anatomy required to produce sophisticated sounds a behaviour known as lip smacking could be related to speech This is friendly action where primates rapidly move their jaws lips and tongues in much the same way that humans do as they speak The problem is that no primates have ever been shown to produce vocalisations while making these facial movements explained Dr Bergman Apart from he said the gelada These primates can do the complex mouth movement and vocalise at the same time Further analysis also revealed the rhythm in the sound closely matched the patterns heard in human languages Dr Thore Bergman explained In human speech the onset of a syllable is loud and then there are quiet parts inbetween If you were to look at a waveform where you see how speech gets louder and quieter across time the time between those peaks happens at a fairly predictable frequency of 3Hz to 8Hz across different languages The same thing happens with the gelada wobbles the periodicity has the same frequently Dr Bergman said that this had not been seen in any other primates He said the findings did not give a definitive answer as to how speech arose in humans but they did at least show that a combination of lip smacking and vocalisations could have been a viable step for speech evolution The researchers now want to see if there is any meaning behind the gelada s calls They believe that the primates which live in very large social groups are using the verbal exchanges to bond with each other in a similar way to how humans might use small talk", "A fresh suspected leak of radioactive water has been detected at Japan s tsunami hit Fukushima nuclear plant its operator says

contaminated water from the number two pool which was also leaking The transfer has now been stopped We understand that we have caused tremendous worry to the people of Fukushima and the wider public and we apologise for that Tepco spokesman Masayuki Ono told reporters Tepco said that while water may have leaked into the ground it did not believe the water had reached the sea It was currently investigating the cause and countermeasures said the company in a statement Meanwhile the IAEA said it would send a team of experts to the site of the Fukushima Daiichi power plant from 15 to 22 April to review the government s decommissioning plans for the plant The visit had been requested by the Japanese government the IAEA added In the past month Fukushima nuclear plant has experienced two power outages that shut down some of its cooling systems for spent fuel ponds On 11 March 2011 an earthquake and tsunami crippled the plant Waves knocked out cooling systems for the reactors leading to meltdowns at three of them Engineers have since stabilised the plant but years of work lie ahead to fully contain the disaster and tackle its effects", "The historic drought that blazed across America s corn belt last year was not caused by climate change a federal government study found The summer of 2012 was the driest since record keeping began more than a century ago as well as one of the hottest producing drought conditions across two thirds of the continental United States Barack Obama and other prominent figures have repeatedly cited the drought as evidence of climate change But the report released on Thursday by scientists at five different government agencies said that was not the case The drought was a sequence of unfortunate events that occurred suddenly the report said The circumstances were so unusual the drought could never have been predicted The Central Great Plains drought during May August of 2012 resulted mostly from natural variations in weather the report said The scientists found moist air from the Gulf of Mexico did not stream northward as it does most years bringing spring rain The jet stream that ordinarily pushes up the moisture from the Gulf was stuck far to the north in Canada July and August failed to produce their usual thunderstorms and those that did occur brought little rainfall The deficits were extreme Last year was the driest year since record keeping began in 1895 the report said Conditions were even hotter and drier than the dust bowl years of 1934 and 1935 But the scientists were clear in the report Neither ocean states nor human induced climate change factors that can provide long lead predictability appeared to play significant roles in causing severe rainfall deficits over the major corn producing regions of central Great Plains The finding was immediately challenged by other scientists The report looked at six states Wyoming Kansas Nebraska Colorado Missouri and Iowa but by last September the drought had spread across two thirds of the continental United States devastating crops from Texas to Georgia Some experts predicted the economic losses would exceed those from hurricane Sandy Obama cited the drought along with last year s wildfires record breaking temperatures and Sandy as evidence of climate change Campaign groups have also cited the drought to make the case for climate action The lead author of the report Martin Hoerling a research meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration told the Associated Press he had tried to create computer simulations of the the drought factoring in climate change conditions Hoerling undertook a similar exercise with the 2011 drought in Texas finding that climate change had indeed been a factor He was unable to do so in this case Hoerling said arguing that it demonstrated the drought had been a one off event This is one of those events that comes along once every couple hundreds of years Hoerling told the AP Climate change was not a significant part if any of the event However Kevin Trenberth a climate scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research who was also contacted by the Associated Press said the study failed to take into account the lack of snowpack in the Rockies or how climate change may have played a role in keeping the jet stream away Drought Task Force Report", "A technique based on the same kind of technology used in airport scanners has revealed images beneath a fresco held at the Louvre museum in Paris Trois Hommes Armes de Lances was known to be a fresco forged by Giampetro Campana on a wall from Roman times The new research suggests that under that forgery lies a real Roman fresco The discovery was announced at the American Chemical Society meeting by Bianca Jackson of the University of Rochester in the US Terahertz waves are known for their ability to penetrate materials without damaging them and have in recent years been added to the suite of tools used to examine items of cultural heritage These tools span much of the electromagnetic spectrum from X rays to ultraviolet to the infrared and of course microscopy with visible light Terahertz light which lies between infrared light like that used by remote controls and the microwaves in the appliance of the same name has become popular in scanning technology at airports and museums back rooms because it can extract information without risk of damage It s very desirable for cultural heritage conservation because with a lot of other techniques like X ray or ultraviolet there is some molecular breakdown in the materials Dr Jackson told the meeting So even though you re using the equipment to get information to conserve it you re at the same time risking some deterioration of the object Giampetro Campana was a renowned collector from the mid 19th Century who specialised in Roman artefacts But late in his career he took to restoring or outright creating Roman style works and passing them off as genuine Previous studies of Trois Hommes Armes de Lances had used X ray fluorescence which yields a list of all the atoms within an object but showed that there were atoms present in the work that were not present on the surface Dr Jackson and her colleagues were called in to apply terahertz imaging to find out what lay beneath After quite a bit of data processing we were able to pull out some signs that there is a figure beneath what looked like two eyes eyebrows nose mouth a shadow for a chin she said It remains to be proven that the image beneath is of Roman origin but the collector s history seems to suggest it The original may simply have been of poor quality If you go on Ebay and you can get a Roman coin from 200BC for 25 cents there s a reason it s not high quality Dr Jackson told BBC News So he probably painted over it because he could get more credit if he had a nice painting", "Millions of people could become destitute in Africa and Asia as staple foods more than double in price by 2050 as a result of extreme temperatures floods and droughts that will transform the way the world farms As food experts gather at two major conferences to discuss how to feed the nine billion people expected to be alive in 2050 leading scientists have told the Observer that food insecurity risks turning parts of Africa into permanent disaster areas Rising temperatures will also have a drastic effect on access to basic foodstuffs with potentially dire consequences for the poor Frank Rijsberman head of the world s 15 international CGIAR crop research centres which study food insecurity said Food production will have to rise 60 by 2050 just to keep pace with expected global population increase and changing demand Climate change comes on top of that The annual production gains we have come to expect will be taken away by climate change We are not so worried about the total amount of food produced so much as the vulnerability of the one billion people who are without food already and who will be hit hardest by climate change They have no capacity to adapt America s agricultural economy is set to undergo dramatic changes over the next three decades as warmer temperatures devastate crops according to a US government report The draft US National Climate Assessment report predicts that a gradually warming climate and unpredictable severe weather such as the drought that last year spread across two thirds of the continental United States will have serious consequences for farmers The research by 60 scientists predicts that all crops will be affected by the temperature shift as well as livestock and fruit harvests The changing climate it says is likely to lead to more pests and less effective herbicides The 50bn Californian wine industry could shrink as much as 70 by 2050 The report lays bare the stark consequences for the 300bn US farm industry stating Many agricultural regions will experience declines in crop and livestock production The rising incidence of weather extremes will have increasingly negative impacts on crop and livestock production Climate disruptions have increased in the recent past and are projected to increase further over the next 25 years Critical thresholds are already being exceeded Many regions will experience declines in crop and livestock production from increased stress due to weeds diseases insect pests and other climate change induced stresses Climate disruptions to agricultural production have increased in the recent past and are projected to increase further Lead author Jerry Hatfield director of the US government s national laboratory for agriculture and the environment said that climate change was already causing weather extremes to worsen Very hot nights fewer cool days and more heatwaves storms and floods have already devastated crops and will have increasingly negative impacts he said The report follows recent disastrous harvests in Russia Ukraine Australia and the US In 2010 climate driven factors led to a 33 drop in wheat production in Russia and a 19 drop in Ukraine Separate climate events in each case led to a 14 drop in Canada s wheat output and a 9 drop in Australia A separate US government funded study of the fertile Lower Mekong basin which includes Vietnam Cambodia Thailand and Laos states that temperatures there could rise twice as much as previously expected

should not be built too close to the UK s nuclear plants Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act show that the government rejected advice from the Office for Nuclear Regulation ONR regarding the lessons to be learned following Japan s Fukushima disaster The regulator recommended restricting development near nuclear plants advice that was overridden last week when the government approved the expansion of Lydd airport in Kent a couple of miles from Dungeness nuclear power station Mike Weightman HM chief inspector for nuclear installations wrote a report for the government about the lessons to be learned from the Japanese meltdown which said In light of the events at Fukushima we consider that it is timely for the relevant government departments in the UK to examine the existing system of planning controls for developments in the vicinity of nuclear sites and consider the need for improvements Weightman felt that the current planning control system did not go far enough His argument was then backed by the ONR which recommended to the Department for Energy and Climate Change that there should be a review of the adequacy of planning controls governing the construction of residential and commercial developments near nuclear power plants The regulator demanded that the constraints should be incorporated into the National Planning Policy Framework the government s new overarching document which determines development and has proved controversial with some heritage and environmental groups because of what they perceive to be its pro build ethos The ONR also sought statutory consultee status so that its regulatory advice would be given more weight in planning matters and even wrote to the Department for Communities and Local Government calling for national planning policy to treat safety and security developments in the vicinity of nuclear facilities similar to flood risks The regulator was determined to check future house building and commerical expansion near nuclear plants In 2010 the ONR had outlined the case against the building of new homes next to Aldermaston atomic energy facility only for the secretary of state Eric Pickles to reject its objections In a letter to DCLG obtained by the Observer the ONR explained that the Aldermaston case highlighted the fact that nuclear administrative arrangements for developments around nuclear installations have not been modernised and incorporated into the current national spatial planning framework This means that appropriate weight is not given to nuclear safety and security concerns in the planning balance The regulator was clearly alarmed that the government s draft planning framework document failed to reflect its views The ONR s letter explains the draft framework document makes no mention of any constraint to developments in the vicinity of nuclear facilities nor indeed other high hazard facilities While we recognise and accept the reasoning behind the government s policy presumption in favour of positive planning decisions for these to be sustainable it is important to ensure that we do not undermine other important government policies such as the need to control developments around nuclear installations that are designed to ensure that people and society are properly protected But the energy department rejected the thrust of the regulation office s demands Instead the NPPF stated only that planning policies should be based on up to date information on the location of major hazards and that local planning authorities should consult the appropriate bodies when planning Documents released under freedom of information reveal the ONR s increasing alarm that its demands were being ignored as the framework was developed In an email in December 2011 an ONR official asks his counterpart in the Office for Nuclear Development part of the energy department if there is any pressure you can apply in order to get us a meeting with DCLG Louise Barton of Lydd Airport Action Group described the failure to rein in development near nuclear facilities as reprehensible She said The recommendation was made to save lives What right has Mr Pickles to sacrifice public safety for the sake of growth A department spokeswoman said the letter of October 2011 had raised issues that had been addressed For the first time the framework brings the requirements for local councils to work with the Office for Nuclear Regulation into one place she said This ensures that the presence of a nuclear installation is taken into account in all planning policy decisions", "Waitrose is asking fruit vegetable and flower suppliers to avoid using pesticides linked with bee declines Farmers supplying the supermarket chain are to stop using three neonicotinoid pesticides on products destined for its stores by the end of 2014 as part of a seven point plan by the company to help pollinating insects The move makes Waitrose the latest retailer to take action on pesticides after the Co operative suspended its use on its farms several years ago and more recently leading garden centres removed products that contain the chemicals The approach will be rolled out to crops such as oil seed rape on which the pesticides are commonly used on the Waitrose Farm at Leckford Hampshire and as soon as practicable to other areas of the arable sector that supply the supermarket Waitrose said the measure was a precautionary one which will remain in place until scientists could demonstrate whether the pesticides are harming populations of bees and other pollinating insects many of which are in decline It will also be funding research at the University of Exeter into the effects of multiple pesticide use on pollinating insects Concerns have been raised that neonicotinoids which target insect nervous systems could have immediate and long term impacts on bee colony and survival and development as they damage the insects ability to forage for food The problem has been highlighted in laboratory studies but field based experiments have not concluded there is a link prompting the government to warn against EU moves to ban the pesticides without sufficient evidence But MPs on the cross party environmental audit committee have urged a ban on their use as a precautionary measure Waitrose s managing director Mark Price said the decision to avoid their use was appropriate until conclusive evidence was put forward about the effects of the three chemicals And the company s director of quality and technical David Croft said Given the concern about these pesticides and the need to support pollinators we believe this is a responsible precautionary step as part of a wider holistic approach under our seven point plan The role of pollinating insects such as bees is crucial in sustaining agriculture in the long term as part of a thriving ecosystem that will support food security healthy diets and the wider agricultural economy The move was supported by green groups including Friends of the Earth whose head of campaigns Andrew Pendleton described it as fantastic news There is mounting concern about the damaging impact these chemicals have on bees and other pollinators we urge other stores to follow suit Ministers can t ignore the mounting concern from scientists businesses and the public they must back EU proposals to restrict these insecticides later this month But pesticides are not the only challenge facing British bees the government must introduce a bee action plan to tackle habitat loss and all the other threats they face he said Vanessa Amaral Rogers pesticides officer at wildlife charity Buglife said This is a huge step in the right direction leading the way for other retailers to follow By voicing their concern for pollinators they are adding pressure and weight to the campaign for a ban on the use of neonicotinoids A spokeswoman for the environment department said We respect Waitrose s commercial decision However the government needs to make decisions that will affect everyone based on sound scientific evidence so they can stand up to legal challenge and don t have unintended consequences for food production or the environment We want the European commission to carry out a major new field study to get the best most up to date evidence to allow an informed decision to be made", "One icy morning in February a train pulled into Washington DC It was loaded with environmentalists planning to handcuff themselves to the gates of the White House in protest at the building of a 3 500km oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico Amid the hundreds of placard carrying protesters stood a somewhat incongruous figure in a suit Jeremy Grantham a 74 year old fund manager What we are trying to do is buy time he told reporters Buy time for the world to wake up Grantham who occupies a legendary place in the world of finance for predicting all the major stock market bubbles of recent decades and doing very well in the process had decided after 15 years of low key environmental philanthropy to as he puts it walk the walk I was committed to getting arrested says Grantham a tall slight man as he looks out across the City from his London office on the 15th floor of a glass and steel tower next to the Bank of England He speaks machine gun quickly in a soft mid Atlantic accent But the day before the protest my wife checked with the lawyer who said Don t do that It turned out that being arrested would give him serious problems when it came to travelling I ve had a green card since completing my MBA at Harvard in 1964 Grantham co founder and chief strategist of GMO a Boston based global investment group manages 106bn 69bn of assets on behalf of 1 000 institutional investors and employs 600 people so he decided that the fallout would be too great He was forced to stand back and watch as his daughter Isabel got arrested alongside the actor Daryl Hannah the US s highest profile environmentalist Bill McKibben and Nasa climate scientist James Hansen So he is speaking out instead From where he stands this bubble the carbon bubble is the biggest he s seen We re already in a bad place The worst accidents are only 20 30 40 years from now Such apocalyptic talk is often the preserve of deep green doom mongers the kind of talk that has led many to reject environmentalism But Grantham insists he s guided by the facts alone On some issues immigration and education he would be considered rightwing but with the environment he says he calls it as he sees it He is disdainful of those who ignore the data or worse misinform the public I find the parallels between how some investors refuse to recognise trends and our reaction to some of our environmental challenges very powerful he says There is an unwillingness to process unpleasant data In a bull market you want to believe good news You don t want to hear that the market is going to go off a cliff He finds climate sceptics led by a little army of non scientific persuasive loony lords as he characterises them a barely disguised reference to the former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson and Ukip s Lord Monckton both of whom promote to varying degrees climate sceptic views a frustrating ideological phenomenon They have profound beliefs as opposed to knowledge that they are willing to protect by all manner of psychological tricks So you have people who are very smart great analysts and hedge fund managers who on paper know that their argument is wrong but who promote it fiercely because they are libertarians Anyone with a brain knows that climate change needs governmental leadership and they can smell this is bad news for their philosophy They are using incredible ingenuity to steer their way around facts they do not choose to accept Grantham who was born in Hertfordshire and raised by his Quaker grandparents in Doncaster freely admits to being a late arrival to all this After completing a degree in economics at the University of Sheffield in the early 1960s he worked for a short stint at Shell before going to Harvard for an MBA In 1977 he co founded GMO Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo Making his clients and himself wealthy filled his working days until the mid 1990s And then he went on holiday with his children to the Amazon and Borneo And without thinking about it you start talking about the logs along the side of the river and the lack of mature forests in Borneo He smiles seeing the risk of being accused of being driven by emotion rather than rigorous statistical analysis That played a role but we didn t treat it as an epiphany And he didn t preach For years he has remained Oz like behind the curtain of the environmental movement He has shunned in depth interviews and expressed his views only in quarterly newsletters published on GMO s website where he writes of long term risk climate change and dwindling resources not just oil coal and natural gas but also phosphorus and potash whose use in modern farming methods must be drastically reduced in the next 20 40 years or poorer countries will begin to starve At the same time he has poured an ever larger amount of his personal wealth into his Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment which he runs with family input his children are trustees and minimal staff out of GMO s Boston headquarters The foundation s latest tax filing shows that in 2011 he increased the fund s coffers by 46m 30m bringing the total to something approaching 400m 260m up from 106m in 2006 Ever the wise moneyman he has largely reinvested this money in order to guarantee the foundation s long term security But he also spends about 17m annually on his chosen causes in the process becoming according to one magazine the world s most powerful environmentalist Run your finger down the tax document and you see why In 2011 alone his foundation gave 1m to each of the leading US conservation charities the Sierra Club and Nature Conservancy as well as 2m to the Environmental Defense Fund where his German born wife Hannelore is a trustee and where Isabel has also worked He is perhaps best known in the green world for funding the London School of Economics Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment 2 2m in 2011 and Imperial College London s Grantham Institute for Climate Change 1 9m in 2011 but he funds climate researchers in India too He has written large cheques for the Carnegie Institute of Science the Smithsonian 350 org WWF Greenpeace and keen to counter what he calls the misinformation machine funds environmental journalism at National Public Radio the Center for Investigative Journalism grist org Media Matters and the Yale Forum on Climate Change the Media Until last year when he decided investigative and environmental journalism was dying out due to cutbacks he funded the world s most lucrative journalism award the annual 80 000 Grantham prize for environmental reporting In the past few months however there has been a conspicuous gear shift in his activities In addition to being more outspoken he intends to support new research initiatives particularly into avant garde sustainable farming techniques He talks of a hybrid form of farming that takes the best of organic farming and the best from Big Ag He doesn t rule out compromises such as genetic modification which some environmentalists will find hard to swallow Having said that his interest isn t entirely selfless Fifteen years ago we started a forestry division at GMO because I had fallen in love with land and trees and because I realised it was a mispriced asset class We have done extremely well in that sector outperforming the benchmark for 15 years Many deep greens who claim the root cause for our environmental woes is the slavish quest for economic growth will recoil at the thought of a hard boiled capitalist such as Grantham underpinning so much of the environmental movement He is unconcerned Capitalism does millions of things better than the alternatives It balances supply and demand in an elegant way that central planning has never come close to However it is totally ill equipped to deal with a small handful of issues Unfortunately they are the issues that are absolutely central to our long term wellbeing and even survival More awkwardly he insists his substantial investments in oil and gas don t contradict his green views We need oil If we took oil away tomorrow civilisation ends We can burn all the cheap high quality oil and gas but if we mean to burn all the coal and any appreciable percentage of the tar sands or even third derivative energy intensive oil and gas with fracking for shale gas on the boundary then we re cooked we re done for He does think there s some cause for hope For example the business mathematics of alternative energy are changing much faster than many people realise Looming carbon taxes hopefully in the not too distant future coupled with the increasing affordability of alternative energy will mean that coal and oil from tar sands run the very substantial risk of being stranded assets There there s the amazing fall in fertility rates across the world the absolute minimum hope of survival is a gracefully declining population But China is my secret weapon he says enthusiastically His eyes widen with excitement and he talks quicker and quicker The Chinese cavalry riding to the rescue I have very high hopes for China because they have embedded high scientific capabilities in their leadership class They know this is serious And they are acting much faster now than we are They have it within their capabilities to come back in 30 years with the guarantee of complete energy independence all alternative and sustainable for ever They have an embarrassment of capital We have an embarrassment of debt So they can set a stunning pace which they are doing And they could crank it up To hell with their five year plans they should move up to 25 year plans They would have such low cost energy at the end of it they d be the terror of the capitalist system Low energy and low labour that s the ball game But he argues that there is no reason why the west can t compete Anyone who says government can t do this or can t do that I say a pox on you have a look at the Manhattan Project They did remarkable things They stuck the brightest minds out in the desert They were herding cats with great egos but it worked If we did that on alternative energy we d be home

view yet of a possible human ancestor uncovered in South Africa has revealed an intriguing mix of human and ape traits The two million year old remains of several partial skeletons belonging to a previously unknown humanlike species were found in 2008 near Johannesburg The new analysis shows this species Australopithecus sediba had a human like pelvis hands and teeth and a chimpanzee like foot The findings appear in Science journal In six separate research reports scientists probed further into the anatomy of a juvenile male skeleton commonly referred to as MH1 a female skeleton known as MH2 and an isolated adult tibia or shinbone known as MH4 The specimens were found at Malapa in the famous Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site just to the northwest of Johannesburg They were pulled from a pit a depression left in the ground by a cave complex that lost its roof through erosion Scientists think the female and male could well have been mother and son It seems they died together in some tragic accident that saw them either fall into the cave complex or become stuck in it After death their bodies were washed into a pool and cemented in time along with the skeletons of many other animals sabre tooth cats hyenas antelope even birds and mice The individuals from Malapa fall within a broad group known as the australopithecines upright walking humanlike creatures that roamed Africa between four million and two million years ago An analysis of Au sediba s lower limb anatomy by Jeremy DeSilva from Boston University and colleagues suggests that the species walked in a unique way Its small heel resembles that of a chimpanzee more than it does a human This suggests it likely walked with an inward rotation of the knee and hip with its feet slightly twisted This primitive way of walking might have been a compromise between upright walking and tree climbing the researchers suggest since Au sediba seems to have had more adaptations for tree climbing than other australopithecines The findings suggest that some species of australopithecine climbed trees some walked on the ground and some did both Meanwhile Joel Irish from Liverpool John Moores University and colleagues investigated Au sediba s teeth Like other parts of the skeleton the teeth are a collage of primitive and human like features They bear many resemblances to the teeth of another South African australopithecine known as Au africanus suggesting these two species formed a southern group distinct from East African forms such as Au afarensis represented by the famous Lucy skeleton Lead investigator Lee Berger from the University of Witwatersrand has been investigating whether thinly layered material excavated with the specimens represents fossilised skin from the creatures Prof Berger submitted preliminary findings to the recent Paleoanthropology Society meeting in Honolulu Hawaii", "The world s first test tube baby Louise Brown has led the tributes to the pioneer of IVF who has died aged 87 Prof Sir Robert Edwards was knighted in 2011 five decades after he began experimenting with IVF His work led to the birth of Ms Brown at Oldham General Hospital in 1978 She said he had brought happiness and joy to millions of people IVF is used worldwide and has resulted in more than five million babies Prof Edwards died in his sleep after a long illness Ms Brown said I have always regarded Robert Edwards as like a grandfather to me His work along with Patrick Steptoe has brought happiness and joy to millions of people all over the world by enabling them to have children I am glad that he lived long enough to be recognised with a Nobel prize for his work and his legacy will live on with all the IVF work being carried out throughout the world The University of Cambridge where Prof Edwards was a fellow said his work had an immense impact Robert Edwards is known as the father of IVF and he certainly has a big family Louise Brown born in 1978 was the first test tube baby Since then more than five million children have been born through IVF In vitro fertilisation has completely changed the prospects for couples unable to have children Fertilising an egg with sperm outside the body and implanting the resulting embryo means infertility is no longer a certain barrier to starting a family The technique sparked a huge ethical debate in 1978 and attracted media attention around the world Born in Yorkshire in 1925 into a working class family Prof Edwards served in the British army during World War II before returning home to study first agricultural sciences and then animal genetics Building on earlier research which showed that egg cells from rabbits could be fertilised in test tubes when sperm was added Edwards developed the same technique for humans In a laboratory at Cambridge in 1968 he first saw life created outside the womb in the form of a human blastocyst an embryo that has developed for five to six days after fertilisation I ll never forget the day I looked down the microscope and saw something funny in the cultures Edwards once recalled I looked down the microscope and what I saw was a human blastocyst gazing up at me I thought We ve done it Bob Edwards is one of our greatest scientists said Mike Macnamee chief executive of Bourn Hall the IVF clinic founded by Prof Edwards with his fellow IVF pioneer Patrick Steptoe a gynaecological surgeon Prof Martin Johnson one of his first students said Bob Edwards was a remarkable man who changed the lives of so many people He was not only a visionary in his science but also in his communication to the wider public about matters scientific in which he was a great pioneer He will be greatly missed by his colleagues students his family and all the many people he has helped to have children Prof Peter Braude Emeritus Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at King s College London said Few biologists have so positively and practically impacted on humankind Bob s boundless energy his innovative ideas and his resilience despite the relentless criticism by naysayers changed the lives of millions of ordinary people who now rejoice in the gift of their own child Edwards was too frail to pick up his Nobel prize in Stockholm in 2010 leaving that job to his wife Ruth with whom he had five daughters He remained a fellow of Churchill College Cambridge until his death His work was motivated by his belief as he once described it that the most important thing in life is having a child Nothing is more special than a child he said", "Slate It is part of the look and feel of Wales and now there are efforts to have its iconic status more formally recognised on the international stage Experts want it listed as one of the great natural stones to have had an impact on human culture the world over Since Roman times the quality of Welsh slate has made it a premier building material with top architects still demanding it for prestige projects This makes it a candidate for Global Heritage Stone Resource status Other rocks that will be considered are likely to include one or two of those exquisite Italian marbles such as Carrara and that other redoubtable British building block Portland stone The case for many is being made in a special session here in Vienna this week at the European Geosciences Union EGU General Assembly The story of Welsh slate is one of incredible cultural heritage said Dr Jana Horak the head of mineralogy and petrology at the National Museum of Wales Roman forts in North Wales were using slates from AD77 it was being exported from medieval times and then the industry really took off during the industrial revolution You can find it now in so many places Even in Australia today they are replacing original slate roofs with more Welsh slate to keep that look It s not just a good slate it s the best she told BBC News At its peak the Welsh slate industry was extracting about 500 000 tonnes of the material each year Production has now fallen to a tenth of that as cheap cement based products have come to dominate the building industry But there are still a handful of mines in operation supplying especially the prestige sector Slate is a metamorphic rock what started out as a mudstone has had its clay mineral make up altered under conditions of raised pressure and temperature over millions of years Grains of platy white mica become aligned perpendicular to the direction of compression The thin banding that develops is what allows the skilled craftsman to split the rock into slender sheets Welsh slate is very strong but because of the critical spacing of these white mica zones it is possible to split it very very finely explained Dr Horak That obviously makes for a lighter slate which is advantageous because you do not then need such a big infrastructure to hold the roof up North West Wales is recognised as the region producing the best product It occurs in two strips that straddle a line running through the Llyn Peninsula The original sediments in the Bethesda Nantlle Belt are Cambrian in age a little over 500 million years old the Blaenau Ffestiniog belt is slightly younger Ordovician Both experienced their metamorphism during tectonic events in the Silurian Period about 400 million years ago The colours range from the traditional grey through to purple and green Diverse textures are evident as well To see many of these forms in one place one only need look up at the fa ade of the Millennium Centre in Cardiff The architect Jonathan Adams is very stone aware and went around Wales picking out examples for their colour and textural variation He also brought traditional slate workers down from North Wales to supervise the cutting The Millennium Centre is a wonderful advert for Welsh slate But argues Dr Horak there are plenty of other fine examples in recent years also and she cites two US buildings the Exxon HQ in Texas and Boston Airport in Massachusetts A proposal is already being made to have the Welsh Slate Province those two slate bearing bands designated as a Unesco World Heritage Site Getting a Global Heritage Stone Resource designation would be slightly different although highly complementary It is a new award being promoted by international scientific societies that are keen to raise the profile of building stone and the part it has played in the human tradition It would help set definitions and standards to guide architects and conservation bodies It could also give some measure of protection to traditional industries and supplies argues Dr Barry Cooper who holds an adjunct position at the University of South Australia and is a leading light behind the award If a stone was designated as an international heritage resource people are going to be less likely to want to cover in a quarry and restore the environment because that resource may be needed for the future restoration of old buildings he told BBC News It s also for example about names If a restoration was taking place it might be possible for a cheaper product to be used perhaps a cheaper foreign stone instead of an old fashioned British or European stone But by designating it and defining it and giving it a name architects and builders can very clearly specify the stone they want for a restoration project The first Global Heritage Stone Resource designations are likely to be awarded in the next few years Jonathan Amos INTERNET bbc co uk and follow me on Twitter BBCAmos", "A new DNA database is being set up to hold genetic information on all the rhinoceros horn in

species is one of our six wildlife crime priorities and within that the number one issue for us is the illegal trade in rhino horn says unit head Det Insp Nevin Hunter In Africa white rhino numbers are rising But despite this a rapid rise in the incidence of hunting means that if present trends continue it won t be long before the population begins to dwindle Poachers are driven by the high prices paid in China and Vietnam for rhino horn strongly but wrongly believed to have powerful medicinal properties Stealing antique rhino horn kept in the UK can deliver similar profits with much lower risks If we want to make inroads into the illegal trade in endangered species DNA will certainly be the key tool to do that As one curator in East Anglia said to me Thieves fleeing from a county museum are unlikely to get shot In the past two years there have been at least 20 criminal incidents involving rhino horn in the UK and it s not just old trophies at risk live animals in zoos have been targeted PC Andy Long a wildlife crime officer in Essex who advises Colchester Zoo on keeping its rhinos safe says it is highly organised crime at an international level They know how to obtain the horn and they know how to dispose of it you can t just sell it on eBay he says Some criminals also try to pass off freshly poached specimens as antique The police say precise DNA knowledge will deter thieves enable officers to secure more convictions and prevent smugglers making bogus claims It is part of an emerging effort to use the latest science to push back against smugglers and prevent them cloaking their crimes in the anonymity of their goods The shavings of rhino horn contain cellular material that has DNA within it and it s this DNA we will look to isolate to build the individual profiles Ross McEwing from international forensics service Trace says If we want to make inroads into the illegal trade in endangered species DNA will certainly be the key tool to do that Dr Lucy Webster who is co ordinating the government funded science from a lab outside Edinburgh usually spends her time investigating DNA at wildlife crime scenes But she is now using genetic science as a preventative weapon This is where your DIY skills come in handy she says We ll be providing museums with a kit with which to take the sample including a 5mm drill bit The shavings of rhino horn contain cellular material that has DNA within it and it s this DNA we will look to isolate to build the individual profiles Zoos will be encouraged to gather cheek swabs or blood samples The precise technique will be left up to the keepers who know best how to get biological material from their potentially grumpy two tonne donor while giving least offence At Colchester Zoo staff stroked Otto the

hearings will start in June in The Hague in the Netherlands the court said in a statement on Thursday Australia took legal action against Japan over whaling in 2010 There has been a ban on commercial whaling for 25 years but Japan catches about 1 000 whales each year for what it calls research But critics say it is commercial whaling in another guise Australia is requesting the UN court to halt a Japanese whale research programme which includes hunting in Antarctica using a special permit The court is scheduled to hear oral arguments from representatives of both countries from 26 June to 16 July New Zealand supporting Australia is also expected to make submissions to the court Australia will now have its day in court to establish once and for all that Japan s whaling hunt is not for scientific purposes and is against international law Australia s attorney general Mark Dreyfus said Australia wants this slaughter to end Japan for its part said it would argue that its whaling activity was legal Japan will defend its whale hunt as it is within the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling rules which is the founding document of the IWC International Whaling Commission a Japanese official told the AFP news agency", "Across the world s great deserts a mysterious sheen has been found on boulders and rock faces These layers of manganese arsenic and silica are known as desert varnish and they are found in the Atacama desert in Chile the Mojave desert in California and in many other arid places They can make the desert glitter with surprising colour and by scraping off pieces of varnish native people have created intriguing symbols and images on rock walls and surfaces How desert varnish forms has yet to be resolved despite intense research by geologists Most theories suggest it is produced by chemical reactions that act over thousands of years or by ecological processes yet to be determined Professor Carol Cleland of Colorado University has a very different suggestion She believes desert varnish could be the manifestation of an alternative invisible biological world Cleland a philosopher based at the university s astrobiology centre calls this ethereal dimension the shadow biosphere The idea is straightforward she says On Earth we may be co inhabiting with microbial lifeforms that have a completely different biochemistry from the one shared by life as we currently know it It is a striking idea We share our planet with another domain of life that exists like the realm of fairies and elves just beyond the hedgerow as David Toomey puts it in his newly published Weird Life The Search for Life that is Very Very Different from Our Own But an alternative biosphere to our own would be more than a mere scientific curiosity it is of crucial importance for its existence would greatly boost expectations of finding life elsewhere in the cosmos As Paul Davies of Arizona State University has put it If life started more than once on Earth we could be virtually certain that the universe is teeming with it However by the same token if it turns out we have failed to realise that we have been sharing a planet with these shadowy lifeforms for eons despite all the scientific advances of the 19th and 20th centuries then we may need to think again about the way we hunt for life on other worlds Robot spacecraft such as the Mars rover Curiosity are certainly sophisticated But what chance do they have of detecting alien entities if the massed laboratories of modern science have not yet spotted them on our own planet This point is stressed by the US biologist Craig Venter As he has remarked We re looking for life on Mars and we don t even know what s on Earth The concept of a shadow biosphere was first outlined by Cleland and her Colorado colleague Shelley Copley in a paper in 2006 in the International Journal of Astrobiology and is now supported by many other scientists including astrobiologists Chris McKay who is based at Nasa s Ames Research Centre California and Paul Davies These researchers believe life may exist in more than one form on Earth standard life like ours and weird life as they term the conjectured inhabitants of the shadow biosphere All the micro organisms we have detected on Earth to date have had a biology like our own proteins made up of a maximum of 20 amino acids and a DNA genetic code made out of only four chemical bases adenine cytosine guanine and thymine says Cleland Yet there are up to 100 amino acids in nature and at least a dozen bases These could easily have combined in the remote past to create lifeforms with a very different biochemistry to our own More to the point some may still exist in corners of the planet Science s failure to date to spot this weird life may seem puzzling The natural history of our planet has been scrupulously studied and analysed by scientists so how could a whole new type of life albeit a microbial one have been missed Cleland has an answer The methods we use to detect micro organisms today are based entirely on our own biochemistry and are therefore incapable of spotting shadow microbes she argues A sample of weird microbial life would simply not trigger responses to biochemists probes and would end up being thrown out with the rubbish That is why unexplained phenomena like desert varnish are important she says because they might provide us with clues about the shadow biosphere We may have failed to detect the source of desert varnish for the simple reason that it is the handiwork of weird microbes which generate energy by oxidising minerals leaving deposits behind them The idea of the shadow biosphere is also controversial and is challenged by several other scientists I think it is very unlikely that after 300 years of microbiology we would not have detected such organisms despite the fact that they are supposed to have a different biochemistry from the kind we know about today says Professor Charles Cockell of the UK Centre for Astrobiology at Edinburgh University It is really quite unlikely adds Cockell whose centre will be officially opened this week at a ceremony in Edinburgh Ways need to be found to determine whether or not the shadow biosphere exists says Dimitar Sasselov professor of astronomy at Harvard University and director of the Harvard Origins of Life Initiative If you want a clue you can count up the amount of carbon that is emitted by living things cows sheep grass plants forests and all the planet s bacteria When you do you find there is a discrepancy of around 5 when you compare the amount given off from Earth s standard biosphere and the amount you find in the atmosphere In other words there is slightly too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than can be explained by the emissions of standard lifeforms on Earth There could be an error in these calculations of course Alternatively the shadow biosphere could be responsible for this excess says Sasselov There is plenty of room for a shadow biosphere That is clear Certainly it is not true as some allege that we have strong evidence to show that it does not exist In fact the opposite is true we do not have good enough evidence to dismiss it A key point to note is that scientists although describing the inhabitants of the shadow biosphere as weird still assume they will be carbon based entities Complex chemistry based on other elements such as silicon is possible they acknowledge but these alternatives cannot create the vast range of organic materials that carbon can generate In other words the shadow biosphere if it exists will almost certainly be inhabited by carbon life albeit of an alien variety Billions of years ago life based on different types of carbon biochemistry could have arisen in several places on Earth says Cleland These varieties would have been based on different combinations of bases and amino acids Eventually one based on DNA and on proteins made from 20 amino acids formed multicellular entities and became the dominant form of life on Earth That is why we find that life as we know it from insects to humans and from plants to birds has DNA as its genetic code However other lifeforms based on different bases and proteins could still have survived in the shadow biosphere A different prospect is highlighted by Sasselov who points out that a complex organic chemical can come in two different shapes even though they have the same chemical formula Each is a mirror image of the other and are said to have a different chirality Amino acids are an example says Sasselov Each comes in a right handed version and a left handed version Our bodies in common with all other lifeforms only use left handed versions to create proteins Right handed amino acids are simply ignored by our bodies However there may be some organisms somewhere on the planet that use only right handed amino acids They could make up the weird life of the shadow biosphere But how can scientists pinpoint this weird life Microbes are usually detected in laboratories by feeding nutrients to suspected samples so they grow and expend Then the resulting cultures can be analysed A weird lifeform such as one made only of proteins formed out of right handed amino acids will not respond to left handed nutrients however It will fail to form cultures and register its existence One solution to this problem is being pursued by Sasselov and colleagues Harvard Origins of Life Initiative They are building an artificial cell or bionic system made only of right handed components including right handed DNA and right handed ribosomes If there are right handed lifeforms out there many of them will be viruses which will attempt to hijack the DNA of our bionic cells adds Sasselov When they do that they will leave evidence of their existence Essentially we are building honey traps to catch any right handed viruses that might live in the shadow biosphere and so reveal their existence Other scientists suggest a different approach by looking at Earth s most inhospitable ecological niches hot vents on the seafloor mountaintops highly saline lakes Antarctic ice sheets and deserts Standard lifeforms mainly bacteria have been found in these places but only a few Some niches researchers speculate may prove to be just too inhospitable for standard life but may just be tolerable enough to support weird life Microscopic studies would reveal their existence while standard culture tests would show they had a different biochemistry from standard lifeforms And a promising example is provided by the desert varnish proposed as a target by Cleland and backed by David Toomey in Weird Life No laboratory microbiologist has been able to coax bacteria or algae to make desert varnish he states It is also possible that the stuff is the end result of some very weird chemistry but no one has been able to reproduce that either So yes these sites could provide proof of the shadow biosphere s existence he argues Not surprisingly Cleland agrees The only trouble is that no one has yet got round to investigating desert varnish for weird life adds Cleland I confess I find that disappointing", "A cyclist killed in a crash in central London was a talented scientist and lecturer doing research on global warming her employer has said Dr Katharine Giles was cycling to

a bright future and was ready to provide the next generation of leadership in the field UCL said She was the second cyclist to be killed in the capital this year A statement from Dr Giles s family said Katharine was a talented scientist responsible for groundbreaking work on global warming Her family are very grateful for all the support and appreciation shown to them over this tragic loss Dr Giles had taken on new commitments at the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at UCL following the accidental death of her colleague Seymour Laxon earlier this year A statement from the head of the earth sciences department Prof Phil Meredith said Coming so soon after the accidental death of Katharine s own closest colleague Seymour Laxon we are all left with a sense of the outrageous unfairness with which some of our best colleagues have been taken from us Katharine had a bright future ahead of her She graduated with a first class degree in earth and space sciences from UCL studied under Seymour for her PhD and went on to forge her own career as a research fellow and most recently as a university lecturer We greatly admired the bravery and sense of purpose with which she took on the many commitments in CPOM following Seymour s demise and it was clear that she was ready to provide the next generation of leadership in that field This makes it all the more difficult for us to accept that Katharine won t now have the opportunity to reach the heights she was sure to achieve The crash happened during the Monday morning rush hour at the junction between Victoria Street and Palace Street", "New research suggests that fracking is not a significant cause of earthquakes that can be felt on the surface UK scientists looked at quakes caused by human activity ranging from mining to oil drilling only three could be attributed to hydraulic fracturing Most fracking events released the same amount of energy as jumping off a ladder the Durham based team said They argue that the integrity of well bores drilled for fracking is of much greater concern The research is published in the Journal of Marine and Petroleum Geology Hydraulic fracturing is not really in the premier league for causing felt seismicity In recent years hydraulic fracturing has become a significant means of recovering oil and gas that is too tightly bound into rock formations to be recovered by normal drilling Fracking as it is called utilises a mixture of water sand and chemicals pumped underground at high pressure to crack open sedimentary rocks and release the fuels within But opponents of fracking have long been concerned that the process could induce earthquakes such as the one that occurred near a shale gas operation in Lancashire in 2011 Now researchers from Durham University s Energy Institute say that the pumping of fracking liquid does indeed have the potential to reactivate dormant fault lines But they say that compared to many other human activities such as mining or filling reservoirs with water fracking is not a significant source of tremors that can be felt on the surface We ve looked at 198 published examples of induced seismicity since 1929 Prof Richard Davies from Durham told BBC News Hydraulic fracturing is not really in the premier league for causing felt seismicity Fundamentally it is is never going to be as important as mining or filling dams which involve far greater volumes of fluid The researchers detailed just three incidences of earthquakes created by fracking one each in the US the UK and Canada The biggest at Horn River Basin in Canada in 2011 had a magnitude of 3 8 Most fracking related events release a negligible amount of energy roughly equivalent to or even less than someone jumping off a ladder onto the floor said Prof Davies What has been shown to cause bigger seismic activity is the underground injection of oil drilling waste water Recent research in the US has linked this to a 5 7 magnitude earthquake in Oklahoma in 2011 This isn t an issue in the UK as the practice of injecting waste water underground is banned by EU legislation If oil and gas exploration companies want to reduce the risk from fracking completely the key thing according to Prof Davies is not to drill too close to tectonic faults By using 3D seismic imaging he says these problem could be identified and the risk of quakes avoided However this technology is not a legal requirement at present and is likely to be resisted as it will increase drilling costs Of greater concern to Prof Davies is the long term threat posed by the well bores that are drilled to allow fracking to take place There have been concerns that over time the cement that is used to line the wells may give way under pressure I think there are some good research questions about the long term integrity of well bores it has been shown in the US and Canada that a percentage have not been cemented properly and are going to leak or do leak that s what I would focus on he added This view is echoed by Robert Jackson professor of environmental sciences at Duke University in the US who has published research on ground water contamination through hydraulic fracturing If I were to emphasise one thing it would be well integrity There are many examples of well integrity issues we know that a certain number of wells leak through time Some people might say 5 but one study suggested as many as half of all wells have sustained casing pressure suggesting there is something wrong he said Prof Jackson says that transparency is key to successfully developing the shale gas industry With new incentives from the Government announced in the budget to boost the recovery of shale gas the likelihood was the fracking industry was going to expand rapidly in the UK According to Prof Jackson this would have implications for people all over the country One thing that will change in the UK is that gas extraction is no longer in the North sea it is in people s neighbourhood he said It is an industrial activity in people s backyards It means trucks dust noise people aren t used to that in the UK Follow Matt on Twitter", "Ahead of one Red Nose day during my school years some friends and I were thinking of ways to raise money when someone suggested we all cycle to school Aged around 12 we were young enough to still love bikes over boys and we were familiar with the route For originality which would surely help with sponsorship we didn t know anyone else who cycled to school We went home thinking it was the best plan ever but when we reconvened the next morning every single parent had said no on the grounds of safety They were happy for us to cycle quiet roads and paths at weekends but busy roads at rush hour were a non starter Today in spite of recent and welcome surges in cycling participation it appears many parents still feel the same Susie Strachan a mother of two says she wouldn t let her seven year old daughter cycle to school on the road Even Poppy Smith whose partner cycled their newborn around in a car seat on a cargo bike would be reluctant to let her children cycle to school before the age of 10 They re not alone According to a 2010 government national travel survey available via the national cycling organisation CTC only 1 of children aged five 10 and 3 of children aged 11 15 cycle to school even though the average distance travelled is just three miles Aside from the obvious physical health benefits the CTC believes cycling can help confidence independence and sense of self worth alongside navigational and roadcraft skills With 45 of children currently travelling by car contributing to 29 of traffic between 8 9am encouraging more children to cycle to school would reduce local congestion and pollution But how do you alleviate parents fears The cycle charity Sustrans has been running the Bike It programme since 2004 Their research has shown that half of schoolchildren would like to cycle Last year they called for cycling to be a part of the national curriculum and they run the Big Pedal an annual competitionthat aims to get children cycling to school as much as possible over a three week period This year kids from 49 secondary and 927 primary schools took part with more than 1 million miles between them Sustrans also have over 120 Bike It officers up and down the country I spoke to Ben Sherratt the Brighton and Hove representative about the task they face But when I mention parents fears and their wish for segregated lanes or children to be allowed to cycle on the pavement he encourages a different viewpoint Ben himself cycles with his children aged six and eight to school and around the community on the weekends Of course it won t be practical for every child Some schools are on massive hills or only accessed by roads where the national speed limit applies but for short journeys to local schools it would be great to see the bike traffic to car ratios rise Parents with kids that cycle would no doubt be more careful drivers around children also Once you start cycling regularly it becomes so embedded in your consciousness that it becomes the only way to travel My children are only nursery age but by the time they re ready for school I hope to have my school run cycle strategy sorted out How about you", "Spring will finally arrive in parts of the UK

Amyris Biotech triumphantly announced production of 70m doses of the anti malarial compound artemisinin This sounds like good news for poor people but may be a step backwards the start of a new hi tech assault on farmers There is no doubt that artemisinin is important Artemisinin combination therapies are the World Health Organisation s drug of choice for battling malaria which caused an estimated 660 000 deaths in 2010 and other artemisinin based approaches also exist Yet the good news stops there Until this week artemisinin for drugs was sourced entirely from the delicate leaves of artemesia annua sweet wormwood following sustained efforts to develop artemesia growing as doubly beneficial a source of livelihood for African and Asian farmers and a public health good What makes Amyris s breakthrough significant is that its version has never been near a wormwood shrub It comes from an industrial vat of bioengineered yeast Making this possible is a controversial technology called synthetic biology synbio This artificially builds DNA strands in labs using those strands to re engineer microbes to behave as tiny factories Ordinary yeast might ferment sugar into alcohol Instead this re engineered yeast turns sugar into a precursor of artemisinin This technical breakthrough nine years in the making was enabled by 53 3m 34 6m from the Gates Foundation It is held up as the poster child for the brave new world of synbio Vat grown artemisinin is highly attractive to large pharmaceutical companies such as Sanofi Aventis pdf They will now avoid the complexity of sourcing from thousands of farmers and 20 000 hectares 50 000 acres in Kenya Tanzania Madagascar Mozambique India Vietnam and China As for artemesia farmers this announcement is an assault on their livelihoods Speaking at a conference in Cambridge this week the key synthetic biologist behind the project Jay Keasling said moves are afoot to replace the entire world supply of the compound Asked whether this means that all natural artemesia production will be replaced he said Early on it was not about replacing the agricultural form and now I think it s nearly inevitable that it will shift over Keasling proffered that artemesia farmers might switch to growing wheat and potatoes instead Keasling argues that putting artemesia growers out of business accompanies a laudable public health move some growers sell to producers of questionable artemisinin monotherapies which in turn may give rise to artemisinin resistance If a single source from a vat replaces the diverse botanical supply it would be easy to control the market and eradicate monotherapies Farmers are unfortunate collateral damaged Keasling s remarks are an astonishing late admission of what experts and civil society groups have feared all along In 2007 the Netherlands Tropical Institute warned that just the prospect of synthesised artemisinin could destabilise prices and dissuade farmers from planting Keasling and his partners rejected such concerns with assurances that there would be no discernible impact on farmers Later they argued that synbio production would only be used to supplement production when botanical supply was flagging Now it turns out that artemesia farmers are dismissed as entirely expendable The rejoinder of let them plant potatoes seems dismissive of farmer knowledge farmers understand markets well and those now growing artemisia annua do so because it helps them bring in income As for the argument that synbio is necessary to eradicate malaria the botanical approach was already producing more than enough artemisinin to address malaria There is simply no rationale to have a synthetic product on the market when farmers could produce enough raw material to produce the tablets from pulverised high quality plants said Professor Hans Herren World Food Prize winner who has worked extensively with east African artemesia farmers Jay Keasling s words are denigrating for farmers he should be ashamed of his work and words It adds nothing to solve the malaria problem at all What may happen to artemesia farmers in Africa and Asia History gives us some clues After the introduction of synthetic chemistry in the 19th century growers of natural dyestuffs in Bihar Bangladesh Mexico Turkey and elsewhere saw collapsing markets famine and deeper poverty Unfortunately far from an isolated story today s artemesinin threat is just an opening salvo in a volley of potentially damaging market disruptions involving synbio Next year synbio company Evolva will commercialise a version of vanilla produced by engineered yeast in a vat Evolva believes it can legally and cheaply sell bioengineered vanilla as natural competing with and undercutting the livelihoods of 200 000 vanilla farmers in Madagascar Reunion Comoros Mexico and beyond Allylix Inc has launched a yeast grown fragrance compound usually extracted from vetiver competing with 60 000 poor Haitian farmers The same story is about to play out with patchouli farmers rubber producers coconut farmers and saffron growers Keasling says that with synbio anything that can be made in a plant can now be made in a microbe For producers of natural plant products that boast should send waves of alarm about this threat to tropical livelihoods In the fight between people and microbes bioengineered microbes may have

new target to beat breast cancer male sex hormones or androgens The University of Colorado team discovered that many breast cancers possess androgen receptors on their surface and that male hormones like testosterone fuel the tumour s growth Drugs to block these receptors could offer another way to fight the disease a meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research heard They plan clinical trials to test this Dr Jennifer Richer and colleagues say more than three quarters of all breast cancers possess androgen receptors and therefore might benefit from anti androgen therapy It s still early days for this research but there s growing interest in the androgen receptor s role in breast cancer as a potential new route to tackle the disease This type of treatment is already used for prostate cancer Experts already know that some breast cancers grow under the influence of female hormones like oestrogen and progesterone The widely used breast cancer drug Tamoxifen works by blocking oestrogen receptors to halt these cancers Dr Richer s research suggests male hormones are also important drivers And adding anti androgen drugs to our armoury against breast cancer could improve treatment success They found many breast tumours possessed both oestrogen and androgen receptors These responded to anti androgen therapy in the laboratory Patients who who relapse while on Tamoxifen but who also have androgen receptors might have the most to gain from this new type of treatment according to Dr Richer She said We are excited to move towards clinical trials of anti androgen therapies in breast cancer Dr Emma Smith of Cancer Research UK said It s still early days for this research but there s growing interest in the androgen receptor s role in breast cancer as a potential new route to tackle the disease Cancer Research UK scientists are among those working on whether targeting this receptor could help treat both those women who develop resistance to other

conservationists anglers fishermen and leisure sailors proposed 127 Marine Conservation Zones The government has consulted on just 31 of these MCZs and MPs on the Science and Technology Committee say sites are being degraded by the delay Ministers say the speed of marine protection is being slowed by complexity and cost It is more than three years since the principle of MCZs was enshrined in the Marine Act with cross party support The MPs say controversy over the zones has increased over that period and the project is losing sight of its original vision The chair Andrew Miller said The Government is currently letting the project flounder while sensitive environments are further degraded and the industry is subjected to further uncertainty It is not clear why some areas have been selected for protection and others not It seems the Government has shifted the goalposts regarding the level of scientific evidence needed to support Marine Conservation Zone designation Site selection should be based on the best available evidence the selection process should not be stalled by an unattainable threshold for certainty This echoes the concern of conservation groups who say that some of the proposed zones rejected by Defra on the grounds of insufficient evidence have compelling reasons to be protected Mr Miller said The Minister must end the uncertainty and set out a clear timetable to designate the zones with a firm commitment to an end date by which the protected areas will be established He also warned that strategic marine science was being undermined by cash shortages The government will formally respond to the committee later It will also publish its findings on the consultation of the first round of proposed MCZs The environment minister Richard Benyon told the committee This is an expensive process for Government We have had to find more money to make sure that the evidence is robust Am I conscious of cost Yes absolutely It would be quite wrong of me not to be But we are learning from this process in a way that means that we can do the rest perhaps quicker and will be able to take forward more sites in the next round Follow Roger on Twitter", "In a remote region of northern Nigeria the signs of a lead poisoning crisis caused by small scale gold mining are still visible especially among children despite a four year clean up project Four year old Umaima stares into space seeming detached from all that is going on around her in the small village of Sumke She has not been able to talk or hear since she was two For some months she was unable to walk until she received medical treatment I feel lucky because a child next door died of the same illness her mother says The contamination in Nigeria s Zamfara state is seen as the worst case of lead poisoning in the world I m never going to stop this work because it s the only way I can earn a living around here More than 460 children have died since 2009 and the health of thousands has been affected The lead is a deadly by product of the small scale gold mining industry in Zamfara The government says the mining is illegal but in this rural Muslim region of north western Nigeria it has been going on for generations and it was a discovery of greater deposits that has led to the recent boom in digging for gold At the Darata gold mine a group of men gather around several deep dark pits waiting for their colleagues who are several dozen feet under the ground hacking away at the rock It is dangerous work and some are down the pits for several days at a time I m never going to stop this work because it s the only way I can earn a living around here says one of the miners as he emerges from a deep pit I know some people have died from poisoning but not from my family and even if anything were to happen it would be a sign of God s will he tells me The sacks of rock which are brought up from underground are carried on the backs of motorbikes to a nearby processing site Here dozens of men and young boys work under the 45C 113F heat hammering rocks operating grinding machines and sifting for gold The danger is in the dust It is full of toxic lead and is carried to the workers homes on their clothes and tools Most at risk are the children because the dust turns their villages into a poisonous playground Their young bodies are vulnerable to the effects of the toxins This crisis began in 2009 The government has not stopped the activity though it says it will introduce safer mining practices which are yet to be seen on the ground President Goodluck Jonathan pledged 4m 2 6m in May 2012 however the money was not released until January It took an online and media campaign by local and international organisations to get the funds released Mercy Abang a journalist and activist from Citizens Platform was part of that drive and says it is not enough for the money to be released but it also has to be used appropriately It s not news that we have a history of misappropriation of funds in Nigeria she says The money has to pass through several stages to get down and it is necessary for us to follow the money at each stage Bagega village is the last of the eight affected communities to be cleaned up over the last four years Using shovels workers dig up and remove all the contaminated soil and replace it with clean earth in some cases the walls of these mud buildings have to be plastered afresh It is a painfully slow process and is not helped by the fact that the equipment promised by the government has not arrived No children in this village can be treated for the effects of the poisoning until this clean up is completed In Sumke village where the toxic soil has been removed the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontiers MSF runs a treatment clinic where mothers bring their affected children to receive medicine It is a complicated drawn out process which for some children could last up to 15 years But the aid agencies will not stay that long MSF s Zackaria Mwatia worries that the government might not be able to take over from them The main challenge we face is we don t see the federal ministry of health on the ground he says We would like them to send the doctors the nurses the laboratory scientists so that we build their capacity They would have built their skills and they will be able to handle this programme successfully Health Minister Dr Muhammed Pate said MSF had no reason to worry This is a man made disaster it is not a natural disaster illegal mining is the underlying reason for this lack of awareness is behind it he says We can t sit behind and not take action Government will continue to take all steps to protect the lives and well being of its people But as the blame is traded thousands of children in these

between humans and insects Love story may be pushing it a bit In human imaginings insects have mainly been used as a metaphor for futility and insignificance God in his wisdom invented the fly wrote Ogden Nash and then forgot to tell us why The insects of the Australian jungle on I m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here eaten in bushtucker trials or dumped en masse on former soap stars and celebrity chefs suffer an extreme version of this centuries long condescension and revulsion It is true we have always reserved a grudging respect for the Hymenoptera insects such as bees and ants who build elaborate nests and form social groups Ever since Plato who admired the way ants could lead such complex social existences without need of the philosophical meaning making that he considered a condition of human life we have been fascinated by the tiny self contained universes these insects create Virgil looked inside a beehive and saw a little model of Roman society the marvellous spectacle of a tiny world and great hearted leaders But this respect for the efficient hierarchies of ants and bees has usually been accompanied by a feeling that there is something alien and soulless about their overly structured lives Still we live meanly like ants wrote Henry David Thoreau in Walden Our life is frittered away by detail However there are signs that we are learning to pay more attention to insects as more of us recognise that without them the world s ecosystems would collapse This growing awareness is partly thanks to the charity Buglife which has just begun a project to create living roofs transforming the tops of urban buildings into wildflower meadows to provide havens for insects A recent series on BBC4 Alien Nation was devoted entirely to the insect world It included a jaw dropping programme Planet Ant which recreated a million strong colony of leafcutter ants at the Glasgow Science Centre in specially designed tunnels that allowed cameras to see inside Within weeks the colony had built a whole working metropolis with everything from ant creches to ant graveyards Ants do not live quite as meanly as Thoreau thought The study of ant behaviour in relation to human society so called ant colony optimisation is a growing field used to work out things such as traffic flow the efficient delivery of goods and the positioning of emergency exits in buildings We are starting to realise that insects are pivotal to our lives not something to be noticed with irritation as we squirt them with fly spray or swot them away Our ignorance and dismissal of them is part of the universal human urge to step over the things commonest and closest to us to ignore the unglamorous and ubiquitous in favour of the rare and beautiful It says more about us than it does about them", "Here s something to inspire every late developer Peter Higgs didn t win a prize for physics until he was 52 Mind you by then he d come up with an idea that changed the Universe or at least how we look at it He set out to explain not just why we are here but why everything is here The dominant theory is that it all began about 14 billion years ago with the Big Bang Almost immediately some of the energy released began to condense into fundamental particles The process of creating the stuff around us matter was under way The process of creating that matter depended on some fundamental particles acquiring mass But how Good question if everything started with a vacuum how could things that had mass come out of nothing It s one of the most important questions in science Without mass the Universe would still be a cloud of fast moving particles Without those particles clumping together no protons no neutrons no atoms no molecules no stars or galaxies or planets No us It was Peter Higgs s achievement to come up with a mathematical solution in Edinburgh in the early 1960s He had no PC they hadn t been invented yet Not even a pocket calculator Just a fountain pen some scrap paper and a mind that could look back billions of years Born to an English father and Scottish mother Peter Higgs showed early promise as an above average scholar At school in Bristol he failed to win prizes only in history and physics His interest in physics grew as he delved deeper into chemistry and in particular the nature of matter His thoughts went deep inside molecules and atoms to the fundamental particles themselves It had to be theoretical physics for a very practical reason he was a pretty hopeless experimenter It wasn t clear what sort of skills I had in other kinds of activity in physics he says In fact I was already I think at the age of 18 showing signs of being incompetent in the lab It can help to think of scientists as model makers They observe what s going on and build a theoretical model they think explains what they see Then they test it Sometimes the model is wrong and falls apart Sometimes it just needs a few tweaks before it stands up And sometimes they find there s a bit missing When it came to the fundamental building blocks of matter some scientists built what they prosaically dubbed the Standard Model It says there are quarks particles that combine to make up protons and neutrons And there are leptons like the electron Quarks and electrons hang together to make up the matter we see around us What makes them hang together are other even more exotic particles called Bosons Different types of Bosons carry different forces the strong nuclear force binds quarks together into those protons and neutrons The weak nuclear force helps the sun shine among other things And the electromagnetic force makes atoms hang together to make the world around us But every time they built the Standard Model they found there was a missing piece how did the particles that had mass get that mass Many people tried to explain it some got close But Peter Higgs came up with the most elegant theory His theory called for a field stretching across the Universe in every direction Some particles pass through it unaffected But other kinds of particles get bogged down in it The more they get bogged down in the Higgs Field the more mass they have And if you could create ripples in the field at a certain point you d see another kind of Boson The Higgs Boson Proving the theory correct would take an enormous international effort and almost half a century It involved creating the biggest and most sophisticated machine humankind has ever built at the CERN nuclear research centre on the outskirts of Geneva The Large Hadron Collider LHC lies in a circular tunnel almost 17 miles round It s so big it s partly in Switzerland partly in France It took 10 years and thousands of scientists and engineers to build it It puts a beam of protons into the emptiest vacuum in the solar system It s colder than the depths of space It accelerates those protons to 99 999999 the speed of light then does the same to an identical beam travelling in the opposite direction Each of the trillions of protons goes round the circle more than 11 000 times a second Enormous detectors dotted around the ring are waiting as is the world s biggest supercomputing grid Because when they smash the two beams together it recreates what happened immediately after the Big Bang The LHC had a much publicised launch in 2008 and an equally public breakdown a few days later But by the summer of 2012 it had been running smoothly for years and there was a growing murmur that something had been found CERN told Peter Higgs a big announcement would be made on 4 July Without being let in on the secret he was strongly advised to come to Geneva That day in the auditorium at CERN both the ATLAS and CMS detectors reported evidence that a Higgs like particle had been found I d never been in a scientific meeting like that before because people got up and cheered and stamped Peter Higgs told me It was a completely new experience Under the world s gaze Professor Higgs shed a quiet tear But when he talks about it now he is characteristically modest I didn t accept that it was me that they were cheering he says I regarded it as cheers for the home team as at a football match and the home team were the two experiments ATLAS and CMS with 1 500 members each And that was what it was really about Maybe they were cheering me too but that was a minor issue The LHC has now shut down for two years of upgrading and maintenance Finding the Higgs Boson was not the sole purpose for which it was designed and built but even so it s widely expected that the Higgs has not given up all its secrets CERN think they ve discovered not the Higgs but a Higgs There s more than semantics to that there could be more than one and perhaps as many as five It means the Higgs may represent more than the final piece of the Standard Model important though that is It could also open the door to dark matter The theory of dark matter has been advanced as a partial explanation for a disturbing problem most of the Universe is missing The matter we can detect accounts for less than 5 of the Universe that should be there A significant chunk of the missing 95 may be dark matter made from heavier siblings of the fundamental particles we already know The Higgs Boson s heavier cousins if they re there may give our first glimpses of the dark Universe Peter Higgs meanwhile is well into retirement from Edinburgh University and perhaps just starting to enjoy a little of the attention he s been getting prizes requests for signed photos public appearances It is at the very least an opportunity to squash a few of the myths which have grown around one man and his Boson Contrary to what you might read elsewhere there was no Eureka moment while walking in the Cairngorms The theory came to him quietly over a number of weeks while at home in Edinburgh And whatever you do don t call it the God Particle when he s around First of all I m an Atheist he says The second thing is I know that that name was a kind of joke And not a very good one I think BBC Scotland Investigates Peter Higgs Particle Man will be broadcast on BBC1 Scotland at 22 35 on Wednesday 17

wetland bird species from continental Europe Species such as whooper swans Cetti s warblers and little egrets have used the nature reserves to colonise new areas of the UK found the scientists The findings are published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B Biological Sciences The effectiveness of the UK s Protected Areas from National Parks to nature reserves was criticised in 2010 by a government review that concluded they were too fragmented and offered limited long term security They fear that climate change might push species out of static reserves said Jonathan Hiley a PhD student at the University of York and co author of the study Protected Areas are often formed to protect individual species so if these species move out the area s strengths can become redundant Why do whooper swans treat Britain as a sunny getaway Watch Arctic terns travel to fish where the sun doesn t set See bar headed geese complete the highest migration on earth To examine whether nature reserves can still offer benefits in these situations Mr Hiley and colleagues conducted research into migrant species as part of a wider project run by the RSPB We have shown that for birds which are shifting range in response to climate change or other factors it is crucial they have good quality habitat to move in to and our reserves provide that habitat he said Twenty previously unrecorded species of wetland bird have arrived in Britain since the 1960s six of which have established continuing breeding patterns Although birds colonising new areas isn t a new phenomenon the last half century has been notable for the number of new wetland bird visitors to the UK said Mr Hiley Some of these species such as Cetti s warbler and little egret were formerly limited to southern Europe but appear to have moved north as a result of more suitable climatic conditions Looking at breeding records Mr Hiley confirmed that all 20 migrant species first appeared in the UK within Protected Areas It appears that UK s Protected Areas provide excellent habitat for these colonisers when they turn up they invariably breed in our nature reserves he said The researchers also found that birds such as whooper swans and common cranes established breeding populations outside of Protected Areas after their initial breeding success in reserves The species that we looked at here can be deemed natural colonists in that they are arriving in the UK from the near continent of their own accord as opposed to non native invaders from further afield such as Canada geese or ruddy ducks which colonise as a result of man made introductions Mr Hiley told BBC Nature He described how the new arrivals are largely welcomed by conservationists and research into how they use nature reserves is ongoing This gives some cause for optimism in the midst of concern that climate change and other factors will imperil many species added co author Professor Chris Thomas Protected areas are helping to give birds and other species a fighting chance of moving into new regions where they can breed successfully Join BBC Nature on Facebook and Twitter BBCNature", "11 April 2013 Last updated at 18 21 European track cycling champion Valery Kaykov has been sacked by his team after failing a drugs test Rusvelo acted after the Russian who won European Track Championship team pursuit gold in 2012 tested positive for fat burning drug GW1516 The 24 year old has also been suspended by the International Cycling Union UCI world cycling s governing body Kaykov had his contract terminated after testing positive for a prohibited substance a Rusvelo statement said He becomes the first athlete to be suspended for using the substance which was withdrawn from research when it was found to cause cancer in rats Kaykov s sacking has come less than a month after Wada warned athletes of the health risks of taking the developmental drug A UCI statement added The provisional suspension of Mr Valery Kaykov remains in force until a hearing panel convened by the Russian Cycling Federation determines whether he has committed an anti doping rule violation under Article 21 of the UCI Anti Doping Rules The UCI said that a German laboratory accredited by the World Anti Doping Agency Wada had found that an A sample of Kaykov s urine collected during an out of competition test on 17 March contained the banned substance The rider has the right to request a test of his B sample Kaykov who finished second in the Madison at last year s European Track Cycling Championship in Lithuania in addition to being one of his country s team pursuit champions is the second Russian rider in five days to fail a drugs test Alexander Serebryakov 25 who rides for Spanish outfit Euskaltel Euskadi was provisionally suspended by

vendor Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire on 17 December 2010 it was in protest at heavy handed treatment and harassment in the province where he lived But a host of new studies suggest that a major factor in the subsequent uprisings which became known as the Arab spring was food insecurity Drought rocketing bread prices food and water shortages have all blighted parts of the Middle East Analysts at the Centre for American Progress in Washington say a combination of food shortages and other environmental factors exacerbated the already tense politics of the region As the Observer reports today an as yet unpublished US government study indicates that the world needs to prepare for much more of the same as food prices spiral and longstanding agricultural practices are disrupted by climate change We should expect much more political destabilisation of countries as it bites says Richard Choularton a policy officer in the UN s World Food Programme climate change office What is different now from 20 years ago is that far more people are living in places with a higher climatic risk 650 million people now live in arid or semi arid areas where floods and droughts and price shocks are expected to have the most impact The recent crises in the Horn of Africa and Sahel may be becoming the new normal Droughts are expected to become more frequent Studies suggest anything up to 200 million more food insecure people by 2050 or an additional 24 million malnourished children In parts of Africa we already have a protracted and growing humanitarian disaster Climate change is a creeping disaster he said The Mary Robinson climate justice foundation is hosting a major conference in Dublin this week Research to be presented there will say that rising incomes and growth in the global population expected to create 2 billion more mouths to feed by 2050 will drive food prices higher by 40 50 Climate change may add a further 50 to maize prices and slightly less to wheat rice and oil seeds We know population will grow and incomes increase but also that temperatures will rise and rainfall patterns will change We must prepare today for higher temperatures in all sectors said Gerald Nelson a senior economist with the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington All of the studies suggest the worst impacts will be felt by the poorest people Robinson the former Irish president said Climate change is already having a domino effect on food and nutritional security for the world s poorest and most vulnerable people Child malnutrition is predicted to increase by 20 by 2050 Climate change impacts will disproportionately fall on people living in tropical regions and particularly on the most vulnerable and marginalised population groups This is the injustice of climate change the worst of the impacts are felt by those who contributed least to causing the problem But from Europe to the US to Asia no population will remain insulated from the huge changes in food production that the rest of the century will bring Frank Rijsberman head of the world s leading Cgiar crop research stations said There s a lot of complacency in rich countries about climate change We must understand that instability is inevitable We already see a lot of refugees Perhaps if a lot of people come over on boats to Europe or the US that would wake them up China is relatively resilient to climate change Its population is expected to decline by up 400 million people this century easing demand on resources and it has the capacity to buy in vast quantities of food But because more and more Chinese are changing to a more meat based diet its challenges will be land and cattle feed Climate change will affect regions in different ways but many crops are expected to migrate northwards Crop losses are increasingly being caused by extreme weather events insect attacks and diseases The 2011 drought lifted food prices worldwide Wheat is becoming harder to grow in some northern areas of China as the land gets drier and warmer In southern China droughts in recent years have replaced rainy seasons The national academy of agricultural sciences expects basic food supplies to become insufficient around the year 2030 A new study for US Aid expects most of Vietnam Cambodia Laos and Thailand to see 4 6C temperature rises by 2050 The Lower Mekong region of 100 million people which is prone to weather extremes could also see rainfall increase 20 or more in some areas reducing the growth of rice and other staple crops Many provinces will see food production decline significantly The number of malnourished children in the region may increase by 9 to 11 million by 2050 Extreme events will increasingly affect agriculture in Australia Key food growing regions in the south are likely to experience more droughts in the future with part of western Australia having already experienced a 15 drop in rainfall since the mid 1970s The number of record breaking hot days in Australia has doubled since the 1960s also affecting food output Climate change affects agricultural production through its effects on the timing intensity and variability of rainfall and shifts in temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations Crops normally seen growing in the south of Europe will be able to be grown further north This would allow more sweetcorn grapes sunflowers soya and maize to be grown in Britain In Scotland livestock farming could become more suitable At the higher latitudes warmer temperatures are predicted to lengthen and increase the intensity of the growing season But more CO2 and a major temperature rise could cut yields by around 10 later in the century Latest EU projections suggest the most severe consequences of climate change will not be felt until 2050 But significant adverse impacts are expected earlier from more frequent and prolonged heatwaves droughts and floods Many crops now grown in southern Europe such as olives may not survive high temperature increases Southern Europe will have to change the way it irrigates crops In Europe s high and middle latitudes global warming is expected to greatly expand the growing season Crops in Russia may be able to expand northwards but yields will be much lower because the soils are less fertile In the south the climate is likely to become much drier which will reduce yields In addition climate change is expected to make water resources scarcer and encourage weeds and pests In 2011 Russia banned wheat and grain exports after a heatwave Warming will increase forest fires by 30 40 This will affect soil erosion and increase the probability of floods In the Middle East and north Africa declining yields of up to 30 are expected for rice about 47 for maize and 20 for wheat The US is expected to grow by 120 million people by 2050 Government scientists expect more incidents of extreme heat severe drought and heavy rains to affect food production The warming is expected to continue without undue problems for 30 years but beyond 2050 the effects could be dramatic with staple crops hit According to the latest government report The rising incidence of weather extremes will have increasingly negative impacts on crop and livestock productivity because critical thresholds are already being exceeded Many agricultural regions of the US will experience declines California s central valley will be hard hit with sunflowers wheat tomato rice cotton and maize expected to lose 10 30 of their yields especially beyond 2050 Fruit and nut crops which depend on winter chilling days may have to relocate Animals exposed to many hot nights are increasingly stressed Many vegetable crops will be hit when temperatures rise only a few degrees above normal Nearly 20 of all US food is imported so climate extremes elsewhere will also have an effect In 2011 14 9 of US households did not have secure food supplies and 5 7 had very low food security Because few crops can withstand average temperature rises of more than 2C Latin America expects to be seriously affected by a warming climate and more extreme weather Even moderate 1 2C rises would cause significant damage to Brazil one of the world s biggest suppliers of food crops Brazilian production of rice beans manioc maize and soya are all expected to decline with coffee especially vulnerable Other studies suggest Brazil s massive soya crop which provides animal feed for much of the world could slump by more than 25 over the next 20 years Two major crops should do well quinoa and potatoes Many African countries are already experiencing longer and deeper droughts floods and cyclones The continent is expected to suffer disproportionately from food insecurity due to fast growing vulnerable populations Egypt expects to lose 15 of its wheat crops if temperatures rise 2C and 36 if the increase is 4C Morocco expects crops to remain stable up to about 2030 but then to drop quickly later Most north African countries traditionally import wheat and are therefore highly vulnerable to price shocks and droughts elsewhere A new study of 11 west African countries expects most to be able to grow more food as temperatures rise and rainfall increases But demand from growing populations may double food prices Climate change may mean Nigeria Ghana and Togo can grow and export more sorghum raised for grain Temperatures are expected to rise several degrees in regions close to the Sahel In Burkina Faso the sorghum crop is expected to decline by 25 or more but maize yields may improve Other studies by IFPRI suggest crop yields across sub Saharan Africa may decline 5 22 by 2050 pushing large numbers of people deeper into destitution A new UN study suggests climatic conditions in southern Africa will worsen Climate models mostly predict an increase in annual maximum temperatures in the region of 1 to 2C by 2050 This will favour some crops but shift others to higher ground or further north Both of Africa s staple crops maize and sorghum are expected to be badly hit by increasing severity of weather Oxfam warns that small scale farmers in the Horn of Africa will bear the brunt of the negative impacts of climate change Unpredictable weather here has already left millions semi destitute and dependent on food aid", "Archaeologists have found coins pottery shoes lucky charms and an amber gladiator amulet An archaeological dig in the heart of the City will transform our understanding of Roman London experts claim About 10 000 finds have been discovered including writing tablets and good luck charms The area has been dubbed the Pompeii of the north due to the perfect preservation of organic artefacts such as leather and wood One expert said This is the site that we have been dreaming of for 20 years Archaeologists expect the finds at the three acre site to provide the earliest foundation date for Roman London currently AD 47 The site will house media corporation Bloomberg s European headquarters It contains the bed of the Walbrook one of the lost rivers of London and features built up soil waterfronts and timber structures including a complex Roman drainage system used to discharge waste from industrial buildings Organic materials such as leather and wood were preserved in an anaerobic environment due to the bed being waterlogged Museum of London archaeologists MOLA who led the excavation of the site say it contains the largest collection of small finds ever recovered on a single site in London covering a period from the AD 40s to the early 5th Century Sadie Watson the site director for MOLA said We have entire streets of Roman London in front of us At 40ft 12m the site is believed to be one of the deepest archaeological digs in London and the team have removed 3 500 tonnes of soil in six months More than 100 fragments of Roman writing tablets have been discovered Some are thought to contain names and addresses while others contain affectionate letters A wooden door only the second to be found in London is another prize find MOLA s Sophie Jackson said the site contains layer upon layer of Roman timber buildings fences and yards all beautifully preserved and containing amazing personal items clothes and even documents The site also includes a previously unexcavated section of the Temple of Mithras a Roman cult which was first unearthed in 1954 The preserved timber means that tree ring samples will provide dendrochronological dating for Roman London expected to be earlier than the current dating of AD 47 The artefacts are to be transported back to the Museum of London to be freeze dried and preserved by record as the site will eventually become the entrance to the Waterloo and City line at Bank station Once Bloomberg Place is completed in 2016 the temple and finds from the excavation will become part of a public exhibition within Bloomberg s headquarters", "It is a quiet lane overhanging trees creating a tunnel of green gloom which has inspired some of the greats of English literature Keats and Coleridge once walked here both enthralled by the birdsong of nightingales Today Millfield Lane in north London remains one of the most secluded tracks through Hampstead Heath a shaded trail that snakes past woods and bathing ponds and finishes at Kenwood House the impressive former stately home at the top of one of London s finest lungs But the lane s renowned tranquillity is under threat A handful of putative but spectacular developments stretching along the lane which would not look out of place on television s Grand Designs are causing deep disquiet Some local residents fear they will spoil the country feel of the lane others worry about the disruption caused by builders lorries and the threat the massive developments present to the Heath s fragile water table At the heart of the row is a wider concern the power of the ultra wealthy to circumvent planning laws even if it means spending millions on buying crumbling properties only to knock them down The most advanced development a 13 000 sq ft futuristic glass and steel house with chutes spiralling down from the first floor to the swimming pool below is only weeks from completion In recent months graffiti has appeared on the temporary wooden fence around the building site attacking Camden council for approving the development How did this get planning permission someone scrawled with a marker pen However the property s owner believed to be a hotelier has gone some way to placating the local and often voluble Fitzroy Park residents association Having knocked the original house down on site to make way for the new modernist property disruption was kept to a minimum and local groups were consulted throughout construction We worked with the neighbours and all the interested groups said Neil Westwick associate director of Nathaniel Lichfield Partners which handled the planning application That s the key to planning you ve all got to get on Westwick did concede that the new building currently clashed with its bucolic surroundings Without the trees it s a bit stark but it will blend into the Heath once summer arrives and we re able to progress with tree planting But some local people fear that the development will see mega homes mushroom along the Heath s borders At least five homes in the Fitzroy Park area have major planning applications before the council Several appear to be seeking to squeeze more square footage out of their existing plot of land either by demolishing the existing building or digging down that is excavating It sets a dangerous precedent said Mary Cane of the Kenwood Ladies Pond Association whose natural swimming pool lies less than 100 metres from the new developments There is a concern that the unpretentious older domestic dwellings in Fitzroy Park will be bought by greedy bankers with large bonuses in their pockets so that they can build huge houses with giant basements and extensive servants quarters A previous attempt by a Russian oligarch to build a stucco fronted neo Georgian mansion on one of the sites known as the Water House was abandoned following vociferous opposition that attracted the support of local celebrities including actor Tom Conti and Monty Python star Terry Jones Residents complained that any development on the site would have an impact on the water table and claimed that hundreds of heavy lorries would have to use the lane to remove soil Paul Munford a financier who specialises in luxury asset finance and who recently resubmitted plans to the council to develop a single storey property on the site said he had commissioned five independent hydrology reports which concluded there would be no impact on the water table He insisted that only about four lorries a day would run up and down the lane for around six months and that the development which has a green roof that cannot be seen from the Heath would be very low impact Munford is aware of the controversy but points out that Hampstead is an area rich in modern architecture much of it unpopular when it was first unveiled Ern Goldfinger s modernist home and Berthold Lubetkin s art deco buildings Highpoint I and II were both attacked when they were built in the 1930s but are now considered of huge historical importance Hampstead is a place where good ideas and great architecture have been and should continue to be allowed to flourish Munford insisted But his attempts to mollify his critics have been given short shrift by the Ladies Pond Association whose position remains unchanged since it wrote to the council in 2011 explaining that Millfield Lane in its current form could not cope with the heavy lorries needed to move thousands of tonnes of soil It said the lane was one of the very few remaining country lanes possibly in the whole London area untarred and unlit and we do not want to see it changed The association s comments have been echoed by the Highgate Society which observes that north London s multi millionaires are spreading out beyond their traditional enclave around The Bishops Avenue one of Britain s most expensive roads because they must now live as close as possible to Hampstead Heath where their grandiose architectural fantasies can be looked upon in awe by as many people as possible To the heritage brigade the spread threatens to undermine the Hampstead Heath Act of 1871 which charged the City of London with keeping the Heath open unenclosed and unbuilt on Munford however believes that planning laws should not act as a brake on cutting edge architecture if it is sympathetic to its natural surroundings and quotes with approval the maxim that an Englishman s home is his castle It appears an intractable row one in which emotions run deep As Keats observes in the opening line of On the Grasshopper and Cricket The poetry of earth is never dead guardian co uk today is our daily snapshot of

west China and are about 190 million years old They belong to a group of dinosaurs called Lufengosaurus long necked beasts that fully grown would have stood about 9m 30ft in height The creatures were preserved at different stages of their development shedding light on life inside the egg Lead researcher Robert Reisz a palaeontologist from the University of Toronto Mississauga in Canada said We are looking at various stages in the embryonic life of this animal and we can put this together to get a growth trajectory of the embryo itself something that has never been done before Reporting the findings in the journal Nature the international team concluded that the animals would have grown extremely quickly during their incubation period Short lives Fossil finds have revealed a wealth of information about the dinosaurs that once roamed the Earth but little has been known about the very earliest stages of their lives Three years ago palaeontologists discovered fragments of fossilised bones in China s Yunnan Province An analysis revealed that these were the remains of about 20 Lufengosaurus embryos whose lives were cut short by a flood Prof Reisz said The nests were inundated by water and basically smothered and the embryos inside the eggs died and then decayed And then more water activity moved the bones and concentrated them into a very small area We only excavated 1sq m of the bone bed and we got more than 200 bones The researchers studied the fossils using a variety of techniques including histology and infrared spectroscopy with a synchrotron in Taiwan The neat thing is that we can get these materials in our hands we can handle them cut them we can look inside the bones and what we found out is they are growing quite fast faster than other dinosaurs and faster than a lot of living animals whose embryology we know very well While the researchers cannot establish how long the incubation period was this finding does suggest that it was short The team believes the animals emerged well developed and might have continued to develop quickly Professor Reisz said We are hypothesising if this very fast growth rate we see in the embryos was maintained in the hatchlings and the juveniles then we have a very fast growth rate in the initial stages of the life of this animal The Lufengosaurus belongs to a group of dinosaurs called the sauropodomorphs and is a predecessor of the sauropod a true giant of the dinosaur world that could grow up to 60m 200ft in length You can hear more about this research on the BBC World Service programme Science in Action a

womb The Institute of Cancer Research experts analysed the entire three billion letter sequence of DNA coding in identical twins to reveal what sets off the disease They hope the findings published in PNAS journal could lead to new drugs to fight the condition at source Leukaemia is the most common cancer diagnosed in children It affects a third of young cancer sufferers and kills 100 children a year in the UK It told us for the first time that this is the key mutation that starts the whole process of leukaemia The twins studied by the researchers had the most common form of leukaemia that affects children acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ALL which is a cancer of the white blood cells It is already known that multiple faulty genes are linked to the condition and that environmental factors probably act as triggers along the way But the precise sequence of events leading up to a diagnosis of ALL is unclear The researchers wanted to find out more about the disease so that ultimately a better treatment could be found Although ALL is often curable the medicines used to treat it can cause unpleasant and sometimes severe side effects Prof Mel Greaves and his colleagues decided to study identical twins who shared the same DNA inherited from their parents Both twins developed ALL in early childhood at around four years of age By comparing blood and bone marrow samples of the twins in later childhood the researchers found one genetic mutation identical in both twins a common leukaemia causing gene called ETV6 RUNX1 The researchers reason that this mutation must have arisen in one of the twins while in the womb Cells carrying the mutation then spread to the other twin via their shared placental blood circulation The identical twins had a total of 22 other mutations but none of these mutations was shared by both twins and so they must have accumulated after birth as the disease progressed say the researchers Study co author Prof Greaves said We were able to sequence the entire human genome It told us for the first time that this is the key mutation that starts the whole process of leukaemia The other mutations must have happened after birth Dr Julie Sharp of Cancer Research UK said This interesting research shows how studying the DNA of twins can shed light on the genetic mistakes that first initiate cancer in children and the subsequent faults that occur as the cancer evolves Studies like this could reveal new ways to target the very roots of cancer and help us better understand how the disease develops over time Survival rates have increased significantly over the past decades thanks to research but there is still more to do to make treatments better with fewer side effects", "The number of people prosecuted for cruelty to badgers has almost doubled in five years new figures suggest The data obtained by Labour MP Diane Abbott showed 58 people were prosecuted in magistrates courts under the Protection of Badgers Act in 2011 up from 30 in 2007 Ms Abbott said pro cull campaigning had given a green light to those carrying out crimes such as badger baiting The government said unlicensed killing of badgers was unacceptable Two trial badger culls aimed at tackling the spread of tuberculosis TB in cattle are set to go ahead later this year in Gloucestershire and Somerset They had been postponed late in 2012 amid fears they could not be carried out effectively but were approved in February after final licence conditions were met A reserve pilot will also be prepared in Dorset If anyone has any evidence of that occurring they are strongly encouraged to report this to local wildlife crime police officers to deal with The figures revealed by Ms Abbott in a parliamentary question showed that prosecutions for crimes including badger baiting have risen each year since 2007 with only a minor dip to 48 in 2010 from 50 in 2009 Speaking in Parliament Ms Abbott said the rise was alarming stressing she believed this kind of cruelty is barbaric We ve got to send the message out that this kind of thing is wrong The laws are clear so we need to talk about why these incidents are increasing she said The Labour MP added she was concerned that there are gangs of people sometimes with dogs who think this is a macho thing to do The problem is that some of campaigning on badger culling has given a green light to this kind attitude to our wildlife Labour has opposed a badger cull arguing it will cost more money than it saves put strain on the police and could even spread TB as badgers flee to different parts of the country Responding to the figures a spokesman for the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs said Any killing of badgers without a licence is illegal and unacceptable If anyone has any evidence of that occurring they are strongly encouraged to report this to local wildlife crime police officers to deal with The government has previously said the cull of badgers is necessary as part of a science led programme to tackle TB which has been devastating to farmers", "A documentary examining the treatment of killer whales in captivity claims that the giant mammals that have delighted generations of children are being deeply traumatised by their conditions The movie which is called Blackfish and will be released in July in the UK and the United States focuses on an animal called Tilikum who has been involved in the death of three humans including the killing of trainer Dawn Brancheau in 2010 Tilikum who was born in the wild and caught off Iceland in 1983 is still a main attraction at SeaWorld in Orlando Florida He performs regularly in front of crowds though his direct interaction with trainers is strictly controlled The movie argues that Tilikum whose name means friend in the Native American Chinook language has been mentally scarred by his experience of being captured while young and then subjected to rough training techniques in confined spaces He was also bullied by other whales that he shared a tank with The result Blackfish suggests is not the frolicking happy tame beast that SeaWorld presents to thrill millions of visitors each year but an aggressive animal who is a danger to his trainers The film details the first death in 1991 of young trainer Keltie Byrne in the now closed Canadian park Sealand of the Pacific and then a second incident in 1999 in which a man who stayed behind at SeaWorld after it shut ended up dead in Tilikum s tank after apparently sneaking into the water with him Finally it examines Brancheau s death which played out in front of a crowd many of whom did not fully understand what was going on as the experienced trainer was dragged under water and flung around the tank Brancheau had been one of the best known handlers at SeaWorld and was used in advertising posters for the theme park The movie made by relatively inexperienced film maker Gabriela Cowperthwaite has already won rave reviews and prompted a surge of criticism of SeaWorld There are probably no words to assuage this damning indictment of the theme park s role in the death of a whale trainer at SeaWorld Orlando nor to convince anyone of the humaneness of keeping wild animals in captivity for human entertainment wrote film critic Carrie Seidman in Florida s Sarasota Herald Tribune Justin Chang a reviewer for the film industry bible Variety magazine called the film a compelling psychological profile of Tilikum The impression the film leaves is of a deep pocketed institution that for all its claims of humane and professional treatment tolerates practices that are fundamentally at odds with the animals wellbeing and refuses to accept any portion of responsibility Chang wrote Cowperthwaite interviewed former staff members at SeaWorld who expressed concerns and doubts about the concept of keeping the animals in captivity The movie also uses disturbing footage of other incidents and near misses where killer whales have threatened or injured trainers Many of those clips were filmed as home videos by park employees and Cowperthwaite was only able to obtain them because the government sued SeaWorld following Brancheau s death and they became accessible to the public The director also worked closely with writer Tim Zimmermann who in 2010 published an acclaimed article on Tilikum called The killer in the pool in Outside an American lifestyle magazine Zimmermann also speculated that captivity lay at the heart of why Tilikum ended up a killer Tilikum before 26 years in marine parks once knew what it was like to swim the ocean alongside his mother and family And perhaps just perhaps that also explains why Dawn Brancheau died he wrote No one from SeaWorld responded to a request for comment from the Observer Nor did the park provide anyone to appear on film in Cowperthwaite s documentary But SeaWorld has previously denied any examples of wrongdoing In a statement the firm has said that many of the allegations in the movie are unfounded It added The film fails to make the most important point about SeaWorld the company is dedicated in every respect to the safety of our staff and the welfare of our animals The film s release comes at a sensitive moment for the theme park operator SeaWorld is currently planning on floating on the New York Stock Exchange later this year in a move that will value the firm at around 2 5bn The giant corporation owns 11 theme parks and earned some 1 4bn in revenue last year from 24 million visitors With such a major corporate development on the horizon and with its killer whale attractions being so core to its identity the company will be keen to avoid any bad publicity guardian co uk today is our daily snapshot of the top news stories sent

provisional total tolerable intake PTTI set by the US Food and Drug Administration FDA by a factor of 120 The report at the American Chemical Society Meeting adds to the already well known issue of arsenic in rice The FDA told the BBC it would review the research Lead is known to be harmful to many organs and the central nervous system It is a particular risk for young children who suffer significant developmental problems if exposed to elevated lead levels Because rice is grown in heavily irrigated conditions it is more susceptible than other staple crops to environmental pollutants in irrigation water Recent studies have highlighted the presence of arsenic in rice prompting consumption advice from the UK s Food Standards Agency and more recently from the FDA However other heavy metals represent a risk as well Dr Tsanangurayi Tongesayi of Monmouth University in New Jersey US and his team have tested a number of imported brands of rice bought from local shops The US imports about 7 of its rice and the team sampled packaged rice from Bhutan Italy China Taiwan India Israel the Czech Republic and Thailand which accounts for 65 of US imports The team measured the lead levels in each country category and calculated the lead intake on the basis of daily consumption The results will be published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Health Part B When we compared them we realised that the daily exposure levels are much higher than those PTTIs said Dr Tongesayi According to the FDA they have to be more than 10 times the PTTI levels to cause a health concern and our values were two to 12 times higher than those 10 times he told BBC News So we can only conclude that they can potentially cause harmful effects That factor of 120 12 times higher than 10 times the PTTI alluded to by Dr Tongesayi is for Asian children who are most susceptible by virtue of age and comparatively high rice intake on average For non Asian adults the excesses above the PTTI ranged from 20 to 40 Rice from China and Taiwan had the highest lead levels but Dr Tongesayi stressed that all of the samples significantly exceeded the PTTIs Dr Tongesayi has also worked on quantifying arsenic contamination and is in effect working his way through the heavy metals one by one to determine their prevalence The problem he said is the range of agricultural practices around the world If you look through the scientific literature especially on India and China they irrigate their crops with raw sewage effluent and untreated industrial effluent he explained Research has been done in those countries and concerns have been raised because of those practices but it s still ongoing Dr Tongesayi also said that the increasing practice of sending electronic waste to developing countries and the pollution it leads to exacerbates the problem With a globalised food market we eat food from every corner of the world but pollution conditions are different from region to region agricultural practices are different from region to region but we ignore that Maybe we need international regulations that will govern production and distribution of food So far such international oversight exists informally in the form of the Codex Alimentarius a collection of food safety standards first set out by the United Nations FDA spokesman Noah Bartolucci told BBC News that the FDA plans to review the new research on lead levels in imported rice released today As part of an ongoing and proactive effort to monitor and address contaminants in food traded internationally FDA chairs an international working group to review current international standards for lead in selected commodities including rice and to revise if necessary maximum lead levels under the Codex Alimentarius he said", "The Philippines has charged 12 Chinese fishermen with poaching after their boat ran aground a protected coral reef reports say The men face up to 12 years in jail and 300 000 195 784 in fines said an official from the Tubbataha reef park a Unesco World Heritage site They were also charged with bribery after they allegedly tried to pay off Philippine park rangers The US also faces a fine after its ship crashed in the same reef in January The Chinese fishing vessel which measures 48m 157ft ran aground the reef in the Sulu Sea on Monday The fishermen said they reached the reef by accident from Malaysia Philippine officials were quoted as saying Chinese officials have visited the fishermen who are detained in Palawan province local reports say We will seek to quickly prosecute and resolve this case Alen Ross Rodriguez a local official in Palawan told the AFP news agency No one can just enter our waters and wilfully destroy our marine life Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said they had asked the Philippine government to ensure the fishermen s legitimate rights and safety The boat is the seventh Chinese fishing vessel caught in the area since 2002 according to a statement from the Tubbataha reef park The USS Guardian struck the reef south east of Palawan island on 17 January The ship was dismantled to minimise damage to the reef and the US has apologised for the accident Four navy officers on the minesweeper were relieved of their duties According to Unesco the Tubbataha Reef Marine Park is home to a great diversity of marine life Whales dolphins sharks and turtles are among key species found there", "Great scientists change the way we view the world Doing that usually means smashing an old entrenched idea often making enemies in the process Before being proven and accepted a great theory can be subjected to harsh criticism and its proposer can be mocked rejected even vilified Sometimes a religious authority is on the attack other times it s the scientist s colleagues either way it takes special determination to stick to an idea others believe is clearly wrong The genius of the lucky ones is recognised in their lifetime but some are venerated only posthumously Here are five of my greatest scientific heretics I find their courage inspiring Some have become household names while others still remain in relative obscurity Isaac Newton changed everything with his theory of gravity and his laws of motion He showed how nature could be measured and understood His public heresy was to describe the universe as the Sensorium of God which suggested God was actually space and time itself German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz considered investigating God scientifically was abominable He wrote immediately to the Hanoverian Royal Family in England accusing Newton of contributing to the decline of natural religion Forced to defend himself through the philosopher Samuel Clarke Newton perhaps feared an investigation would uncover his secret much greater heresy Although profoundly religious he rejected the divinity of Jesus Christ and the Holy Trinity Newton had good reason to be afraid anti Trinitarianism was explicitly criminalised in the 1689 Act of Toleration Newton also believed that the inspiration for his theory of gravity came directly from God making him a modern prophet We remember Galileo Galilei as the classic scientific heretic due to his 1633 trial by the Roman Catholic Inquisition He was convicted of being vehemently suspected of heresy because he promoted the belief that the Earth moved through the heavens At the time it was accepted that Earth was stationary and the Sun moved through the sky Galileo compounded his crime by insisting a moving Earth did not conflict with scripture This was forbidden Only Vatican theologians were empowered to interpret the Bible His downfall has become a standard point of reference for discussing science versus authority Louis Pasteur is remembered as the man who proved germs carry diseases but he was preceded by the largely forgotten Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis Semmelweis worked in two maternity clinics noticing that in one more mothers succumbed to deadly fevers shortly after giving birth than in the other Investigating he realised the death rate was higher in the clinic where post mortems were being performed This made him suspect that something was being carried on the hands of the doctors from the cadavers to the mothers He instituted a hand washing regime and cut mortality rates by 90 The medical establishment were slow to acknowledge his result however and he became increasingly frustrated By 1861 he was suffering from nervous conditions He obsessively promoted his lifesaving ideas becoming hostile and antisocial towards the medical establishment The more aggressive he became the easier it was for him to be ignored Eventually in 1865 colleagues lured him to a mental institute and straitjacketed him He died a fortnight later from gangrene Ironically that same year British surgeon Joseph Lister was beginning to use carbolic acid sprays as antiseptics He had taken his inspiration from Pasteur s germ experiments and two years later wrote of his success in The Lancet By the end of the decade most surgeons were convinced of the need for cleanliness After Galileo the scientist who comes to mind over a clash with the Church is Charles Darwin He presented the theory that species evolve gradually with time adapting to their environment Some in the Church of England considered evolution heretical as it implied Earth had not been created perfectly Others thought life s ability to adapt was God s design all along Darwin published the idea in 1859 in The Origin of Species using evidence collected during a voyage on HMS Beagle Despite the religious opposition it was adopted relatively quickly by the scientific establishment It entered popular culture when cartoonists portrayed Darwin as an ape Darwin himself rose above most of the controversy but HMS Beagle s captain Robert Fitzroy found it more troubling At an Oxford debate in 1860 he said the theory caused him the acutest pain Holding aloft a Bible he implored the audience to believe God rather than man but the largely scientific crowd shouted him down Meteorologist Alfred Wegener committed his heresy in 1912 Noticing that South America could fit into Africa like a jigsaw puzzle he suggested that all continents had once been joined together Geological forces had split them apart and they then drifted into their modern positions This was completely against the geological establishment who believe that Earth s landmasses were fixed in position They rallied against Wegener ridiculing his idea that continents ploughed through the Earth s crust like a ship through pack ice Isolated Wegener battled on He amassed new evidence and continually published updates on his idea Eventually his ideas were accepted in the 1960s when the weight of evidence proved impossible to ignore But it was too late Wegener had died on a polar expedition back in 1930 aged 50 He braved the arctic winter to take emergency supplies to a meteorological station in the centre of Greenland Returning by dogsled from his successful mission Wegener was overwhelmed by temperatures of 60 C", "Leading environmental figures including broadcaster Sir David Attenborough and mountaineer Sir Chris Bonington have condemned government plans to drop debate about climate change from the national curriculum for children under 14 as unfathomable and unacceptable In a letter to the Sunday Times also signed by academics politicians and business leaders they warn the proposals are short sighted coming at a time when the loss of wildlife and habitats is ongoing and evidence suggests many children are missing out on the benefits of spending time in nature Under the new draft national curriculum for England education on the environment would start three years later than at present and all existing references to care and protection would be removed the letter states This is both unfathomable and unacceptable Today s children are tomorrow s custodians of nature There is a duty to ensure that all pupils have the chance to learn about threats to the natural world to be inspired to care for it and to explore ways to preserve and restore it These proposals not only undermine our children s understanding and love of nature but ultimately threaten nature itself The letter signed by 96 people also including broadcasters Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall and Chris Packham says the government has a commitment to nurturing our children s love and respect for nature under two binding international agreements the UN convention on the rights of the child and the convention on biological diversity s Aichi targets The Guardian revealed last month that draft guidelines for children in key stages 1 to 3 had removed discussion of climate change in the geography syllabus with only a single reference to how carbon dioxide produced by humans affects the climate in the chemistry section All references to sustainable development have also been dropped in a move widely interpreted as the result of political interference The plans caused alarm among climate campaigners and scientists with teachers and student groups also criticising the draft guidelines A 15 year old girl started a petition to the education secretary Michael Gove to keep climate change in the national curriculum for under 14s which has attracted more than 28 000 signatures Critics have pointed out that one of the dangers of waiting until GCSE courses to teach about climate change in any depth is that only a minority of pupils study geography at that level The government s former science adviser Prof Sir David King denounced the government proposals as major political interference with the geography syllabus The proposed changes have been broadly welcomed by some groups including the Geographical Association which represents more than 6 000 geography teachers and the Royal Geographical Society which said the guidelines provided for a better grounding in geography before students tackle climate change The Department for Education has dismissed the idea that climate change is being excised from the national curriculum insisting climate and weather feature throughout the geography curriculum It is consulting on the proposed changes but the letter warns that the place of the natural environment in the national curriculum is more critical than ever", "A tent that blocks light on a sunny day and becomes transparent and waterproof on a dim rainy one could be an outcome of work by US scientists The new material can change between two states when stretched altering both its transparency and its roughness The team from Harvard s Wyss Institute have published their results in the journal Nature Materials The work was inspired by tears which when grouped together form a coating over our eyes with multiple functions Joanna Aizenberg and her colleagues produced an elastic thin film material with nano sized pores This material is then coated and infused with liquid At rest the material is smooth clear and flat droplets of water or oil on its surface flow freely off it But when it is stretched the liquid coating the film recedes into the expanded pores exposing their edges and reducing lubrication causing it to become rougher This rough surface also makes the material more opaque The researchers were able to make every droplet of oil or water placed on the material to run or stop in its tracks a response which the team describes as pinning simply by flexing the material or letting it relax A video demonstration can be seen here The new material is a liquid infused elastic porous surface which is what allows for the fine control over so many adaptive responses above and beyond its ability to repel a wide range of substances Prof Aizenberg explained A whole range of surface properties can now be tuned or switched on and off on demand In addition to the tent idea the researchers say another possible application of the research could be highly precise self adjusting contact lenses that also clean themselves Another might be pipelines that can optimise the rate of flow depending on the volume of fluid coming through them and the environmental conditions outside The new material was inspired by tears which perform many functions in the eye Individual tears join up to form a dynamic liquid film that helps maintain optical clarity while keeping the eye moist protecting it against dust and bacteria and helping to transport waste away The latest work builds on a system developed by the team called Slippery Liquid Infused Porous Surfaces or Slips This is a coating that repels liquids such as oil water and blood However Slips was rigid whereas the new elastic surface allows for fine control over its function", "How Hawk Eye technology will work 11 April 2013 Last updated at 20 30 The Premier League has voted to introduce goal line technology from the 2013 14 season British based Hawk Eye has been awarded the contract to provide the system Hawk Eye uses seven cameras per goal to detect the ball and claims its system is millimetre accurate ensuring no broadcast replays could disprove the decision 1 Seven fast frame cameras located above and around each goal such as on a stadium s roof track the ball s movement within the goal area 2 Computer software analyses information from all the cameras and as soon as it detects the ball has crossed the goal line sends a signal to the official s watch The result can be relayed within one second and is said to be millimetre accurate 3 Hawk Eye can also provide definitive replays to TV outlets The Football Association will install a system at Wembley Stadium in time for August s Community Shield Top flight clubs voted to adopt the system during a meeting of the 20 Premier League chairmen on Thursday Hawk Eye is known for providing tennis and cricket with ball tracking technology Its football system notifies the referee if the ball has crossed the goal line via a vibration and optical signal sent to the officials watches within one second Inventor Paul Hawkins said It will not slow the game down it is not going to become like rugby In under a second we will provide the information to the watch then afterwards we will show a TV replay that will definitively prove what we showed the referee was correct Football s a great game It does not need enhancements to add to the drama Our technology is there to ensure decisions are correct England manager Roy Hodgson welcomed the Premier League s move saying it would prevent gross injustices affecting results It is something that people in football have wanted for a long time There s been a big debate and for a while it was pushed back but now everyone s on the same page and we ve introduced it said Hodgson At least it will stop some of those gross injustices that we have seen in recent years where goals have obviously been scored and not allowed Once work is under way installation of the system for the 17 Premier League clubs who avoid relegation and the three teams promoted from the Football League is expected to take up to six weeks to complete Richard Scudamore chief executive of the Premier League added When these incidents come along they are so controversial so seismic that it is all about getting it right Some involved in the game hope that this is the start of a technological revolution Off side decisions and contentious fouls could also benefit from video analysis something that Fifa insist will not happen But many believe that the game has opened Pandora s box by approving systems for goal line decisions While English football looks set to embrace change the Champions League will continue to live without digital help as the European football authority Uefa remains ideologically opposed to its use And that s something that looks set to persist for as long as Michel Platini remains as its president If there is some technology available to help the officials get it right then it is right we should be doing it Stoke City chairman Peter Coates also welcomed the decision but was wary about whether the use of technology should be extended to look at other areas such as offside decisions I think we should be careful he said The great thing about our game is that it should be simple free flowing and that it carries on We don t want to become like a rugby game so I m probably in favour of simplicity and keeping a lot as it is West Ham co owner David Gold was open minded on further use of the technology He said It s a start who knows where it will take us Fans will have a big say in this and also TV will have a big say We want to take the big bad decisions out of football and this kind of technology will do that It s been a good day for football Momentum for the introduction of goal line technology increased after Ukraine were denied an equaliser when the ball appeared to cross the line in a 1 0 defeat by England at Euro 2012 Gross injustices will stop Hodgson The following month the International Football Association Board IFAB in Zurich approved two systems for use in the sport At this time the Premier League said it wanted to see its introduction as soon as is practically possible After the IFAB vote Fifa president Sepp Blatter said Frank Lampard s ghost goal at the 2010 World Cup played a decisive role in the decision Lampard s goal came when England were 2 1 down in the second round against Germany Fabio Capello s team went on to lose 4 1 Lampard welcomed the Premier League s decision saying It s a no brainer It s been a long time coming but they got here in the end It s a simple thing that will bring an excitement factor when it s used And it will give you the correct answer which I think when it s used at this level is so important We need that This entry is now closed for comments 530 JonPonty perhaps I m a old duffer but no ones mentioned 1966 Thats probably becuase the technology wasn t available then but with the 2 inccidents that have been mentioned in this article the tech was there but we weren t using it I just don t see the point in bringing up a goal from nearly 50 years a time when we didn t have the technology to do this or get instant replays Report this comment Comment number 532 Link to this Comment number 532 What annoys me about the anti technology brigade is their desperation to find some fault in any system such as it ll waste two minutes or it can t happen in every game Just because a system is not perfect that does not mean it should be completely dismissed I would like a referral system with a 4th official watching a monitor Wouldn t work for everything but still an improvement Report this comment Comment

child said the late Prof Sir Robert Edwards He was one of the pioneers of in vitro fertilisation known as IVF alongside his colleague Dr Patrick Steptoe Sir Robert who has died aged 87 was born in Batley outside Leeds in September 1925 World War II and service in the British Army delayed his eventual emergence in the scientific world In 1951 he graduated from the University of Bangor in Wales and then completed his doctorate at the University of Edinburgh in 1955 It was at Edinburgh that he met his wife Ruth Around this time he began to work on the processes of fertilisation that critical moment when a man s sperm and a woman s egg join to create new life Animal studies had shown that it was possible to fertilise an egg in a laboratory instead of inside the body The team of Dr Steptoe and Prof Edwards were trying to achieve the same results in people It took until 1968 for the first glimmers of success They fertilised an egg which then began to develop and reached the blastocyst stage after five to six days Prof Edwards said I ll never forget the day I looked down the microscope and saw something funny in the cultures I looked down the microscope and what I saw was a human blastocyst gazing up at me I thought We ve done it However there would be another decade of trials and tribulations before the first test tube baby Their work was refused funding by the UK s Medical Research Council in 1971 and they had to rely largely on private donations to continue their work It was also vigorously opposed by groups including the Catholic Church and scientists were concerned about abnormalities in any babies born through these procedures There were many failed attempts the first pregnancy was ectopic but one of the childless couples treated were Lesley Brown and her husband John They had been trying to conceive for nine years but now she was pregnant The media storm was intense We were concerned that she would lose the baby the foetus because the press were chasing Mrs Brown all over Bristol where she lived said Prof Edwards in 2008 So secretly Patrick Steptoe hid the mother in his car and drove her to his mother s house in Lincoln the press didn t know where she was In 1978 at Oldham and District General Hospital a tiny baby was introduced to the world The birth of Louise Brown the first test tube baby changed the world forever Being infertile was no longer a guaranteed barrier to having a child Robert Edwards and Patrick Steptoe would then set up the first IVF clinic Bourn Hall in Cambridgeshire in 1980 The opposition to IVF lessened with time and the procedure is now commonplace By 2012 more than five million children had been born through assisted reproductive techniques around the world Dr Patrick Steptoe died in 1988 It was a long wait for a Nobel Prize which was awarded to Prof Edwards for medicine in 2010 A knighthood followed the year later He was one of the giants of science in the 20th Century and pioneered the techniques which have given children to millions of couples", "Does there come a day in every man s life when he looks around and says to himself I ve got to weed out some of these owls I can t be alone in this can I And of course you don t want to hurt anyone s feelings Therefore you keep the crocheted owl given to you by your second youngest sister and accidentally on purpose drop the mug that reads Owl Love You Always and was sent by someone who clearly never knew you to begin with I mean mugs with words on them Owl cocktail napkins stay because everyone needs napkins Ditto owl candle Owl trivet take to the charity shop along with the spool size Japanese owl that blinks his eyes and softly hoots when you plug him into your computer Just when you think you re making progress you remember the owl tobacco tin and the owl tea cosy Then there are the plates the coasters the Christmas ornaments This is what happens when you tell people you like something For my sister Amy that thing was rabbits When she was in her late 30s she got one as a pet and before it had chewed through its first phone cord she d been given rabbit slippers cushions bowls refrigerator magnets you name it Really she kept insisting the live one is enough But nothing could stem the tide of crap Amy s invasion started with a live rabbit while Hugh s and mine began in the late 1990s with decorative art We were living in New York then and he had his own painting business One of his clients had bought a new apartment and on the high domed ceiling of her entryway she wanted a skyful of birds Hugh began with warblers and meadowlarks He sketched some cardinals and blue tits for colour and was just wondering if it wasn t too busy when she asked if he could add some owls It made no sense nature wise owls and songbirds work different shifts and even if they didn t they would still never be friends No matter though This was her ceiling and if she wanted turkey vultures or as was later decided bats that s what she would get All Hugh needed was a reference so he went to the Museum of Natural History and returned with Understanding Owls The book came into our lives almost 15 years ago and I ve yet to go more than a month without mentioning it You know I ll say There s something about nocturnal birds of prey that I just don t get If only there was somewhere I could turn for answers I wish I could help you Hugh will say adding a second or two later Hold on a minute what about Understanding Owls We ve performed this little routine more times than I can count but back then when the book was still fresh smelling and its pages had not yet yellowed I decided that because Hugh actually did get a kick out of owls I would try to find him a stuffed one My search turned up plenty of ravens I found pheasants and ducks and foot tall baby ostriches I found a freeze dried turkey s head attached to its own foot but owls no luck That s when I learned that it s illegal to own them in the United States Even if one dies naturally of a stroke or old age If it chokes on a mouse or gets kicked by a horse Should one fly against your house break its neck and land like magic on your front stoop you re still not allowed to stuff it or even to store its body in your freezer Technically you re not even allowed to keep one of its feathers that s how protected they are I learned this at a now defunct taxidermy shop in midtown Manhattan But if you re really interested the clerk I spoke to said I ve got a little something you might want to see He stepped into the back room and returned with what I could only identify as a creature What we ve done he boasted is stretch a chicken over an owl form That s really something I said groping for a compliment The truth was that even a child would have seen this for what it was The beak made from what looked to be a bear claw the feet with their worn down pedestrian talons I mean please This was what a chicken might wear to a Halloween party if she had 10 minutes to throw a costume together Let me think about it I said Years later we moved to Paris where within my first week I found an albino peacock I found swans and storks and all manner of seabirds but again no owls because stuffing them is forbidden in France In the UK though it s a slightly different story You can t go out and shoot one certainly They re protected in life just as they are in the US but afterwards in death things loosen up a bit Most of the owls I saw in Britain had been stuffed during the Victorian era I d see them at English flea markets and in Scottish antique shops but as is always the case the moment you decide to buy one they re nowhere to be had I needed one or decided I did in February 2008 Hugh and I were moving from our apartment to a house in Kensington and after going through our owl objects and deciding we could do without nine tenths of them I thought I d get him the real thing for Valentine s Day I should have started looking a month or two in advance but with Christmas and packing and helping to ready our new place it had slipped my mind Thus I wound up on 13 February calling a London taxidermy shop and asking if they had any owls The person who answered the phone told me he had two both recent specimens and freestanding not behind glass as most of the old ones are The store was open only by appointment and after arranging to come by the following afternoon I went to where Hugh was packing books in the next room and said I am giving you the best Valentine s Day gift ever This is one of those things I do and immediately hate myself for How is the other person supposed to respond What s the point For the first 18 years we were together I d give Hugh chocolates for Valentine s Day and he d give me a carton of cigarettes Both of us got exactly what we wanted and it couldn t have been easier Then I quit smoking and decided that in place of cigarettes I needed say an 18th century scientific model of the human throat It was life size about 4in long and because it was old handmade and designed to be taken apart for study it cost quite a bit of money When did Valentine s Day turn into this Hugh asked when I told him that he had to buy it for me What could I say Like everything else holiday gifts escalate The presents get better and better until one year you decide you don t need anything else and start making donations to animal shelters Even if you hate dogs and cats they re somehow always the ones who benefit Eventually we ll celebrate by spaying a few dozen kittens I said but until that day comes I want that throat On Valentine s Day I carried a few boxes from our apartment to the house we d bought It looked like the sort of place where Scrooge might have lived a narrow brick building miserly in terms of space and joined to identical equally grim houses on either side of it From there I walked around the corner and got on the underground The taxidermy shop was on a quiet street in north London and as I approached I saw a man and his two sons with their faces pressed against the barred front windows A polar bear one of the boys shouted The other tugged on his father s coat And a penguin Look at the baby penguin My heart raced The man who owned the shop was so much taller than me that in order to look him in the eye I had to throw my head all the way back like I do at the dentist s He had enviably thick hair and as he opened the door to let me in I noticed an orange kitten positioned on the floor beside a Dalmatian puppy Casting a shadow upon them was a rabbit standing upright on its hind legs and above him on a shelf sat two tawny owls each mounted on a stump and standing around 20in high Both were females and in great shape but what I d really wanted was a barn owl Those are the ones with spooky white faces like satellite dishes with eyes We do get those from time to time but they re rare the taxidermist said Above his head hung a massive seagull with its beak open and next to him on a tabletop lounged a pair of hedgehogs I ve seen better variety but there was no denying that the man did beautiful work Nothing had crooked eyes or bits of exposed plaster at the corners of its mouth If seen in a photo you d think that these animals were alive and had gathered peacefully to boast about their excellent health The taxidermist and I discussed the owls and when my eyes cut to a glass doored cabinet with several weather beaten skulls inside it he asked if I was a doctor Me For some reason I looked at my hands Oh goodness no Then your interest in those skulls is non professional Exactly The taxidermist s eyes brightened and he led me to a human skeleton half hidden in the back of the room Who do you think this was he asked Being a layman all I had to go by was the height between four and a half and five feet tall Is it an adolescent The taxidermist invited me to guess again but before I could he blurted It s a Pygmy He then told me that in the 19th century the English went to what is now the Congo and hunted these people tracked them down and shot them for sport Funny how quickly this changed the mood But he could have died of a heart attack right I said I mean how are we to know for certain that he was murdered Oh we know all right the taxidermist told me It would have been disturbing to see the skeleton of a slain Pygmy in a museum but finding him in a shop for sale raised certain questions uncomfortable ones like how much is he If you like the odd bits and pieces I think I ve got something else you might enjoy The taxidermist retreated to the area behind his desk and pulled a plastic bag off an overhead shelf It was I noticed from Waitrose a grocery store described to me upon my move to England as a cut above From the bag he removed what looked like a platter with an oblong glass dome over it Inside was a man s forearm complete with little hairs and a smudged tattoo The taxidermist said completely unnecessarily Now there s a story behind this For what human limb in a Waitrose bag is not without some sort of story He placed the platter on the table and as the lid was lifted and set to the side I was told that 100 years ago the taxidermist s grandfather witnessed a bar fight between two sailors One was armed with a sabre and the other apparently was disarmed with one After it happened the crowd went wild The amputee fell on his back and as he lay there in shock bleeding to death the taxidermist s grandfather looked down at the floor at the blood soaked fingers that may have still been twitching and likely thought Well it s not like it s doing him any good The story sounds a bit far fetched but there was no denying that the arm was real The cut had been made two inches south of the elbow and the exposed end with its cleanly severed radius and ulna reminded me of osso buco It was my grandfather who mummified it the taxidermist said You can see it s not the best job in the world but it s really rather good for a first attempt I leaned closer Touch it the taxidermist whispered As if I were under a spell I did shuddering a little at the feel of the hairs Equally creepy was the arm s colour which was not Caucasian flesh tone but not brown either the way most desiccated body parts are This was the same slightly toasted shade as a spray on tan I think I ll just take one of those owls I said The one on the left if that s OK The taxidermist nodded Then he reached to an even higher shelf and brought down another plastic grocery bag this one from Tesco which is decidedly less upscale Now a smell is going to hit you when I open this up but don t worry he said It s just the smoke they used to preserve the head That s a phrase you don t hear too often so it took a moment for it to sink in When he opened the bag I saw that he might more accurately have said the head of this teenage girl for she d been no older than 14 at the time of her death This sounds super grisly but is I propose just medium grisly The head was 400 years old and came from somewhere in South America Peru I think he said The skin was dry and thin like leather on an old worn out purse Parts of it were eaten away exposing the skull beneath it but what really struck me was her hair which was sleek and black divvied into delicate slender braids I didn t ask the price but said a little more emphatically I really think the owl will do it for me today It s a Valentine s Day present perfect for our new place A house actually no basement and three storeys tall I wasn t trying to be boastful I just wanted him to know that I was loved and that I lived above ground A few minutes LATER the owl secured in a good sized cardboard box I headed back to the underground Ordinarily I d be elated I d been determined to find Hugh the perfect present and by golly I had done it but instead I felt unhinged not by the things I had seen so much as by the taxidermist It s common to be misread by people who don t know you Like to try Belligerent the new fragrance for men I ll be asked in a department store And I always think Really Do I seem like the kind of guy who would wear cologne Hotel operators so often address me as Mrs Sedaris that I no longer bother to correct them I ve been mistaken for a parent a pickpocket and even God forbid an SUV owner and I ve always been able to brush it off What s rare is not to be misread The taxidermist knew me for less time than it took to wipe my feet on his mat and with no effort whatsoever he looked into my soul and recognised me for the person I really am the type who d actually love a Pygmy and could easily get over the fact that he d been murdered for sport thinking breezily Well it was a long time ago Worse still I would flaunt it hoping in the way a Porsche owner does that this would become a part of my identity They say he has a Pygmy I could imagine my new neighbours whispering as I walked down the street Hangs him plain as day in the corner of his living room next to the musket he was shot with I d love to be talked about in this way but how did the taxidermist know Plenty of people must go into his store ask for a kitten or a seagull or whatever and walk out five minutes later knowing nothing about the human parts Why show me the head in the grocery bag As for the arm how had he known I d been dying to touch it I hadn t said anything one way or the other so what was the giveaway At the station I went through the turnstile and stood on the platform until a train arrived The owl wasn t heavy in fact it was surprisingly light but the box was cumbersome so I was happy to find a seat At our first stop a teenage girl in a school uniform got on and took the spot across from me Deal with a kid her age today and the thought of her head winding up behind some shop counter in a plastic bag might not be all that troubling I mean the mouths on some of them That said it shouldn t be just any kid that age The one the taxidermist showed me for instance what was her story Fourteen year olds existed 400 years ago but teenagers with their angst and rebelliousness their rage and Ritalin and very own version of Vogue magazine are a fairly recent construct In the 17th century jungles of Peru a kid that age would have babies already Half her life would probably be over and that s if she was lucky To have your chopped off head preserved and then wind up in a Tesco bag some 6 000 miles away that was the indignity Tesco At least the arm was in a Waitrose bag It bothered me that the bag bothered me more than the head did but what are you going to do A person doesn t consciously choose what he focuses on Those things choose you and once they do nothing it seems can shake them Find someone with a similar eye and Christmas shopping is a breeze I can always spot something for my sisters Gretchen and Amy The three of us can walk into a crowded party and all zoom in on the person who s missing a finger or who has one regular size ear and one significantly smaller one while my sister Lisa will pick up something else entirely Hugh and I don t notice the same things either That s how he can be with me Everything the taxidermist saw is invisible to him my superficiality my juvenile fascination with the abnormal my willingness to accept and sometimes even celebrate evil point this out and he ll say David My David Oh no He s not like that at all A person who s that out of it deserves both an owl and chocolate so I got off the train at Piccadilly Circus and picked him up a box Then I caught a bus and hurried toward home thinking about love and death and about that throat so elegant in its detail which was no doubt awaiting me Extracted from Let s Explore Diabetes with Owls by David Sedaris

called ag gag laws could be copied in other countries including the UK The laws are designed to limit undercover investigations on factory farms by campaigning groups Around a dozen states have passed or are proposing legislation banning these activities Supporters say they are designed to protect the privacy of farmers and agriculture businesses Such atrocious public policy sets a dangerous precedent for UK industry as does the introduction of US style mega farms Large intensive factory farms have shown significant growth in the US over the past 20 years Between 2002 and 2007 the total number of livestock on the biggest of these farms grew by more than 20 But concerns over the conditions in which cattle pigs and poultry are raised and slaughtered have prompted many animal welfare groups to mount undercover investigations Because there is no single US federal law that protects animals welfare investigators have played a significant role in bringing public attention to inhumane practices In 2008 a distressing video of staggering cattle secretly recorded at a California slaughter plant led to the biggest meat recall in US history Last year a recording from a pig farm in Wyoming was used to secure convictions against a number of workers for cruelty However in Utah and Iowa the undercover recording of videos like these is now illegal Several other states including Indiana Arkansas and Pennsylvania are considering similar laws Other provisions in these bills require prospective farm employees to disclose any link to animal welfare groups These regulations are already having an impact says Cody Carlson a former investigator who has documented inhumane activities on farms in several US states When I applied for a job in Iowa in 2009 and they asked me if I had any affiliations to animal protection groups I would have had to say yes I wouldn t have gotten the job and I wouldn t have been able to expose the conditions that raised questions about the egg industry there he told BBC News It is exactly what these industries want they want to shut down the conversation that s going on about what is happening with the animals we raise for our food In California an animal welfare bill doesn t appear to be as restrictive as many of the others under consideration It is supported by the California Cattlemen s Association and it requires anyone who records video or other evidence of cruelty to turn it over to the authorities within 48 hours But campaigners are highly sceptical arguing that requiring the handover of material so quickly would undermine an investigation and prevent the collection of wider evidence of inhumane behaviour They ve done a clever twist on it Charity Kenyon from the Slow Food Movement told BBC News They want to make it look like their concern is animal abuse but it is all part of the same deal which is to prevent ongoing investigations of the type that ended in the largest recall of beef in the history of the US she said Welfare groups say that the American Legislative Exchange Council is the moving force behind these laws This group supports conservative causes and promotes legislation to limit the role of government They have described animal rights campaigners as terrorists They support the laws because they believe investigators are threatening the privacy rights of individuals and businesses However they declined to be interviewed by the BBC for this article While the ag gag laws are primarily designed to have impact within the US many feel they will also have an impact outside the country As factory farming spreads like a plague around the world said Matt Rice from Mercy for Animals international agribusiness interests will certainly attempt to import America s ag gag laws along with its tainted meat and animal abuse The UK and other nations should be on high alert In the UK Peta the animal welfare charity said these US laws were shameful Such atrocious public policy sets a dangerous precedent for UK industry as does the introduction of US style mega farms said Peta s Ben Williamson Legislators should instead be passing laws to require cameras in all abattoirs and factory farms in order to catch animal abusers he said Others are concerned that if these laws are passed consumers around the world will no longer be able to trust that exports of US agricultural products are produced without cruelty A significant amount of meat dairy and eggs produced on US factory farms goes to foreign countries Matt Dominquez from the Humane Society of the US told BBC News Anyone who consumes animal agricultural products imported from the US should be scared This prevents them from knowing what s going on it blocks an entire industry from transparency Follow Matt on Twitter", "Blood and sperm The perfect mix says a tattooed hippy as he licks both off his hands having just had sex with a woman in front of a small audience in a Berlin basement Life giving fluids we are all so afraid of We re so afraid of ourselves It s all organic It s not everyone s idea of popular entertainment but this scene can be experienced at a safe distance in a new documentary F ck for Forest detailing the activities of the group of the same name without the asterisk They enjoy confronting society with sex nudity and bodily fluids but what Fuck for Forest FFF really want to do is save the world So this isn t just pervy performance art it s also fundraising Few people would imagine any overlap exists between pornography and environmentalism but FFF smash the two concepts together right there in their brutally blunt name It s a concise signifier of what they do and how little they care about what you think of it The live displays are a sideline funds are primarily raised via their website which has images and videos of its core staff members and whatever volunteers they pick up on the street in myriad sexual permutations from naked people up trees to chaotic orgies Subscribers pay about 10 a month and the proceeds go towards rainforest conservation projects in South America It s difficult to know how to categorise such an enterprise Is it kinky eco activism Porn for foliage fetishists Exhibitionism with the fig leaf of a good cause FFF have a better question What is more obscene they ask the depiction of people enjoying their sexuality or the destruction of our natural environment Sex is often shown to attract us to buy all kinds of bullshit products and ideas so why not for a good cause says Tommy Hol Ellingsen FFF s Norwegian co founder The human body is considered more offensive and threatening than most things in the industrial world around us like cars but I don t see the naked body in itself as a threat to the morals or values of modern society I think it s more a mass psychosis people have Why we are destroying the planet may be somehow connected to the values modern humans have created for themselves Tommy and his Swedish partner Leona Johansson can talk at great length about the ills of western society freedom of expression the sanctity of nature and nobility of indigenous tribal life but in the documentary their philosophy is put to the test The first half details their eco hippy existence wandering the streets of Berlin propositioning strangers to contribute to the website getting stoned having sex and subjecting audiences to their performance art if the blood and sperm part sounds shocking wait for their terrible folk songs But then FFF s dreams are confronted with reality in the form of a journey to their much idolised Amazon rainforest at the request of a threatened Peruvian tribe It would spoil things to reveal what happens when they get there but let s just say it s not quite the tribal connection they hoped for I really don t want to judge them but my first reaction was they re trying to save people on the other side of the planet when they can hardly help each other says Michal Marczak director of the documentary who spent seven months filming FFF in action They live in a little fairytale wonderland according to their own rules They never plan anything even what they re going to do the next day There are no rules That s what intrigued me about them But Tommy and Leona dispute the impression Marczak s film creates of them as naive hedonists From a cheap guest house in Mexico where they have been attending a worldwide rainforest gathering they explain how the encounter was set up by the film makers They pulled strings to get us to that specific tribe says Tommy For eight years Fuck for Forest has already been working with different native people all over South and Central America and we know a lot about the conflicts there If we had organised that trip we would have known a lot more about that group and specifically what they needed help with but when we got there nobody knew anything about us We wouldn t have ended up in that situation if it wasn t in some way manipulated by the movie directors FFF does in fact have a solid record when it comes to the forest part of their equation While accounting may not look like their strong suit Leona estimates that the non profit organisation has made in the region of 100 000 85 000 a year since it started in 2004 Their website details how the money has been spent on buying up land and promoting permaculture and indigenous lifestyles in Brazil Peru and other countries And as the film attests they also live a frugal lifestyle wearing clothes and eating food they find in rubbish bins rather than spending the charity s money Marczak admits that he facilitated the expedition seen in the film but he never set out to prejudice viewers against FFF he says In fact compared to other NGOs he spoke to in the Amazon their methods are relatively effective A lot of aid workers there seemed to have a kind of post traumatic stress disorder where they come in full of hope and full of western money then after a couple of years they feel depressed that there s not a lot they can do to help In some cases 80 of their money gets lost to middlemen before it reaches the people they re trying to help Their idea is to work with little eco projects where they can oversee them and give money directly In a sense they re doing it the right way FFF s method of directly funding small projects isn t entirely down to strategy It s also because most major aid organisations have rejected them Both the Rainforest Foundation and the Norwegian World Wildlife Fund turned down their donations once they discovered what they did claiming that other donors would disapprove of their fundraising methods It s no wonder FFF feel such affinity with isolated tribes on the other side of the world they don t seem to have many friends and at times they seem determined not to make any When Tommy and Leona first started the website in Oslo they received a grant from the Norwegian government a decision the authorities regretted when Tommy and Leona caused a stir by having sex on stage at a Norwegian music festival later that year while a hardcore band called the Cumshots played along That led to an obscenity trial at which Tommy pleaded for the cause of public nudity and dropped his trousers in court Shortly after they relocated to Berlin where they ve continued to make enemies In 2009 they were ejected from an anarchist congress in the city for insisting on the right to remove their clothes during a workshop entitled Anarchy and Sex The controversy resulted in the entire congress being shut down early In 2011 they took things even further by interrupting the Ascension Day service in Oslo Cathedral with a naked protest in defence of a priest who was sacked for writing about sex Shocked members of the clergy had to drag them off the altar For advocates of sexual freedom they sure rub people up the wrong way If FFF s rose tinted ideology and confrontational stunts haven t made them enough enemies there s also the fact that they deal in pornography ut few of the complaints traditionally levelled at the porn industry really apply to FFF There are no airbrushed hairless cosmetically augmented porn star types to be found on their pages The models are regular members of the public There s no policy towards gender body type sexual orientation or disability although the majority of their 1 300 odd contributors seem to be healthy young and white The people decide what they want to do Nobody is paid You could call it Fair Trade porn My first impression was who the hell would ever watch this says Marczak And even if they would who would pay for it It s really vulgar and its very hairy Nobody shaves their armpits and it s really badly lit But I noticed that the people mostly seem happy in it There are moments when they just left camera on for little while after they ve finished and you see genuine emotion in people like you hardly ever see in porn films As a film maker Marczak grimaces at FFF s amateurish methods but the amateurism is entirely deliberate says Leona Usually the porn industry treats sex more like a product but we have a more impulsive relationship with sex and nudity Sex for us is something that works best when you re not thinking too much The main idea is to have fun not to make a product We don t stage anything It s all based on what people are willing to do for us They don t even use the term pornography she says It s more like a documentary or a nature programme about human sexuality in the modern world That put the makers of F ck for Forest in a tricky position Whenever they were filming we were waiting to film and whenever they stopped we started says Marczak And there were moments when we were filming at the same time and I was asking myself Wait a minute Am I missing something You could possibly argue that F ck for Forest the movie is only slightly less pornographic than FFF themselves But the film views the raw sexuality of the real pornographers through the filter of professional documentary presentation Blood and sperm are kept at a safe remove It s sex with a condom The movie also exposes the ethical and moral jungle of modern society where it s not necessarily straightforward to gauge what s right and wrong and it does so entertainingly at times hilariously FFF aren t all that happy with the documentary but nor are they particularly bothered by it They re into freedom of expression after all And as Marczak observes even negative publicity about the group tends to drive up their recruiting What annoys FFF more is the suggestion that they live lives of carefree indulgence That s bullshit Tommy says We have so much responsibility We have so much to do with these projects It s a really heavy subject to work with sexual repression and ecology With the website all the uploading and emailing we re a small group keeping it together and it s an incredible amount of work But we re subject to so much suspicion and we have to answer for so much of what we re doing We re giving so much of ourselves to this F ck for Forest is available now on iTunes and in cinemas in the UK from 19 April", "Men with prostate cancer and an inherited gene mutation have the worst form of the disease research reveals The BRCA2 gene is linked to hereditary breast cancer as well as prostate and ovarian cancer Now scientists say that as well as being more likely to get prostate cancer men with BRCA2 are also more likely to develop aggressive tumours and have the poorest survival rates They say these men should be treated quickly to save lives This study shows that doctors need to consider treating men with prostate cancer and a faulty BRCA2 gene much sooner than they currently do rather than waiting to see how the disease develops Around one in every 100 men with prostate cancer will have the BRCA2 mutation These men might benefit from immediate surgery or radiotherapy even if their disease is at an early stage and would normally be classified as low risk according to the latest work in the Journal of Clinical Oncology Prostate cancer can grow extremely slowly or very quickly and this is something that is hard to predict early on Some men may live symptom free for a lifetime despite having this cancer For many treatment is not immediately necessary But researchers say men with BRCA2 and prostate cancer should be treated early and aggressively because their tumour is more likely to spread Prof Ros Eeles and colleagues at The Institute of Cancer Research in London and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust found prostate cancers spread more quickly and were more often fatal in men who had inherited a faulty BRCA2 gene than in men without the faulty gene They looked at the medical records of prostate cancer patients which included 61 men with BRCA2 18 men with a similar gene mutation called BRCA1 and 1 940 men with neither mutations Patients with BRCA2 mutations were significantly less likely to survive their cancer living an average of 6 5 years after diagnosis compared with 12 9 years for non carriers They were also more likely to have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis Prof Eeles said It is clear from our study that prostate cancers linked to inheritance of the BRCA2 cancer gene are more deadly than other types It must make sense to start offering affected men immediate surgery or radiotherapy even for early stage cases that would otherwise be classified as low risk We won t be able to tell for certain that earlier treatment can benefit men with inherited cancer genes until we ve tested it in a clinical trial but the hope is that our study will ultimately save lives by directing treatment at those who most need it More than 40 000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year Men with a significant family history of breast and or ovarian cancer in addition to prostate cancer can be offered BRCA1 2 testing at diagnosis but it is not routinely offered to all patients diagnosed with prostate cancer in the UK Dr Julie Sharp of Cancer Research UK said This study shows that doctors need to consider treating men with prostate cancer and a faulty BRCA2 gene much sooner than they currently do rather than waiting to see how the disease develops We knew that men who inherit a faulty BRCA2 gene are at a greater risk of developing prostate cancer but this is the largest study to show that the faulty gene also makes the disease more likely to develop quickly and spread", "Among the first sights to greet visitors to Denmark on the descent to Copenhagen s airport is a sweeping arc of wind turbines rising from the harbor From the airport passengers can board an automatic Metro line that hustles them to the city center in just 15 minutes crossing the path of the City Circle Line a subway project that will place 85 percent of Copenhageners within 650 yards of a Metro station when the line opens in 2018 Everywhere visitors are greeted by streams of bicyclists 36 percent of trips to work or school in the Danish capital are made by bike and more than 20 000 cyclists enter the city center at peak hours filling Copenhagen s 249 miles of cycle tracks Less visible are state of the art facilities where waste heat from power plants is used to keep buildings warm via the world s largest district heating network or where waters from the city harbor are deployed to cool department stores office buildings hotels and data centers These innovations are just a prelude to what is planned in the coming years all designed to make Copenhagen the world s first carbon neutral capital by 2025 Acting on a City Council plan approved last August Copenhagen intends to replace coal with biomass to add more wind and solar electricity to the grid to upgrade energy guzzling buildings and to lure even more residents onto bikes and public transit Copenhageners like the ambition they like being part of the idea of going green for the whole city Copenhagen Lord Mayor Frank Jensen said in an interview with Yale Environment 360 Our focus as a city as citizens is all about livability The mayor said that city residents are putting their own money into the low carbon drive noting that half of the turbines in the harbor wind farm known as Middelgrunden were funded by individual Copenhagen shareholders Clearly Copenhagen s plans face significant challenges especially since city planners expect Copenhagen to add more than 100 000 residents by 2025 But at stake is the notion that a growing modern city with more than a half million inhabitants can systematically wring carbon from its economy The battle to slow climate change will be won or lost in cities which are responsible for more than 70 percent of global CO2 emissions and two thirds of worldwide energy consumption Copenhagen has already made major progress reducing its emissions by 21 percent from 2005 to 2011 The city currently emits about 2 million tons of carbon dioxide a year and earlier initiatives were on target to reduce emissions to 1 16 million tons by 2025 The new plan approved last year will slash CO2 emissions even further to about 400 000 tons by 2025 More time will be needed to wean private cars from fossil fuels So Copenhagen plans to add at least 100 wind turbines to the grid over the next dozen years and wind electricity not used in the city will be exported to other parts of Denmark to offset Copenhagen s remaining several hundred thousand tons of transportation emissions Nearly three quarters of the emissions reductions identified in the 2025 plan will come by transitioning to less carbon intensive ways of producing heat and electricity The goal is a diverse but complementary clean energy supply biomass wind geothermal and solar The Danish energy system is very much a systems solution it s not power as one and heat as one it s integrated J rgen Abildgaard Executive Climate Project Director for the city of Copenhagen says Wind turbines now supply 30 percent of Denmark s electricity and under a national energy plan passed last year that share is set to rise to 50 percent by 2020 Though not as visible as Copenhagen s bicyclists and wind turbines its heating and cooling infrastructure is playing a key role in slashing CO2 emissions One of Copenhagen s most innovative infrastructure projects is the Adelgade cooling plant sheltered within the brick clad shell of a retired power plant in the historic city center Opened in June 2010 the plant is the hub of the country s first district cooling network and a model of climate conscious engineering The Adelgade plant draws cool seawater from an intake pipe located near the picturesque Nyhavn Canal and then delivers the chilled water through insulated pipes to buildings the pipes are located below ground in the same tunnels in which steam is distributed via Copenhagen s district heating network Thomas Grinde an engineer with Copenhagen Energy a private firm owned by the city took me on a tour of the plant He said that every degree Celsius saved by pre cooling with seawater saves 15 percent on electricity at the site s absorption chillers The city estimates that district cooling reduces carbon emissions by nearly 70 percent and electricity consumption by 80 percent compared to conventional air conditioning From the cooling plant Grinde drove me south to the Amager power station complex which sprawls across a spit of land jutting into Copenhagen Harbor There a pilot project supplies geothermal heat directly into the district heating system In March construction began nearby on a clean burning waste to energy plant that will provide electricity and heating to 150 000 households According to Mayor Jensen half of Copenhagen s indoor heating comes from combusting waste The two major combined heat and power CHP stations that serve Copenhagen Amager and Aved re largely burn coal But because waste heat from the stations is sent to the district heating system they operate at around 90 percent efficiency compared to around 40 percent for conventional coal fired power plants Rather than use furnaces or boilers located in individual buildings for heating Copenhagen delivers hot water or steam to radiators via a network of pipes covering 98 percent of the city Under the climate plan district heating is to be carbon neutral by 2025 The Amager and Aved re plants which today burn a limited amount of biomass imported from Poland Russia Sweden and the Baltic countries will replace coal entirely with wood chips and straw certified as sustainable by the Danish Energy Association Copenhagen s pursuit of carbon neutrality also rests on its ability to meet demanding energy efficiency and transportation goals Commercial and residential buildings are to reduce electricity consumption by 20 percent and 10 percent respectively and total heat consumption is to fall by 20 percent by 2025 In an interview Bo Normander director of the Worldwatch Institute s Europe office and a Copenhagen City Council member noted that new buildings in Copenhagen must now be constructed to Denmark s Low Energy Class ratings the 2020 standard calls for near net zero energy buildings It will be considerably harder to achieve energy savings in existing buildings More than 70 percent of Copenhagen s buildings were constructed before the introduction of Denmark s energy efficiency standards and a major hurdle is the so called landlord tenant dilemma since many Copenhageners rent and neither tenants nor landlords have a strong financial interest in retrofitting buildings to make them more efficient Most of the people here rent Marianna Lubanski executive director of the Copenhagen Cleantech Cluster told me If I own a building and I have 10 people living there and I invest a lot of money in energy savings my tenants will get the savings not me We need new ways to share the costs and gains of energy efficiency Copenhagen can t succeed with their plan if they don t find a way She said she would like to see an ESCO energy service company market launch in Denmark where private firms take on the risk of guaranteeing energy savings and in return are paid a fee by landlords or tenants Another key component of becoming a net zero carbon city is further reducing the use of cars Bo Normander like many Copenhageners does not own a car and bikes to work It s the most convenient quickest and healthiest way to get around he said Newcomers to Copenhagen quickly learn the same as did I Within a few weeks of starting a job in Copenhagen in 2008 I abandoned the Metro for a bike which became my year round way of getting around no matter the weather Weekday mornings I pedaled along the perimeter of the cemetery where Hans Christian Andersen and S ren Kierkegaard rest girding myself for the merge into the horde of bicycle commuters racing along N rrbrogade Copenhagen s busiest bike corridor toward the city center It was exhilarating and invigorating and easily the fastest way to my office Why would anyone own a car here I often wondered The question is even more relevant today Intent on reducing transportation s share of the total city emissions currently 22 percent Copenhagen is expanding its cycling and public transit infrastructure to attract even more users The improvements include green wave traffic signals set to the speed of oncoming bikes angled footrests that enable cyclists to rest without dismounting at intersections and an additional 44 miles of cycle tracks paved paths separated from cars and pedestrians by curbs To entice suburban commuters to abandon cars for bikes Copenhagen is partnering with neighboring cities to add wider smoother better lit cycle tracks In April 2012 the first so called bike superhighway an 11 mile link connecting Albertslund with Copenhagen opened Two more are under construction and a total of 26 are planned Normander said By 2025 the city wants 75 percent of trips to be made by foot bike or public transit The city will also invest in alternative fuels Abildgaard said Copenhagen is looking to convert its bus fleet to models powered by hybrid drives running on biogas The city projects that 20 percent to 30 percent of all cars and small trucks and 30 percent to 40 percent of all heavy vehicles will run on electricity hydrogen biogas or bioethanol by 2025 By 2015 85 percent of the city s fleet of 1 000 small vehicles will run on electricity hydrogen or biofuels officials say What will all this cost Direct city investment in the 2025 Climate Plan is estimated to be 472 million through 2025 Add private funds and total investment could hit 4 78 billion over the same period Copenhagen officials say We can see that we have to invest a lot of money to reach the target Mayor Jensen told me But we can see also that we can create a lot of new jobs with that huge investment Copenhagen can be a green laboratory for developing and testing new green solutions Normander was upfront about the challenges He will be watching to see for instance if the Aved re and Amager power plants can sustainably source enough biomass And he worries that as Copenhagen adds 1 000 residents per month traffic will increase even though the city lacks room for additional cars It s a very ambitious plan he said But it s also something we can do", "Puerto Rico has introduced a new law protecting a swathe of the island s coast that has become a major nesting site for the world s largest turtle the leatherback The

the island s Vocero news site Developers had been looking to build hotels golf courses and luxury homes in the area arguing that this would boost the local economy and create jobs But the area boasting lush vegetation and pristine beaches is now likely to become a centre for eco tourism As well as being a nesting site for the leatherback turtle the area is home to more than 860 different types of flora and fauna It also contains a bioluminescent bay featuring micro organisms which glow in the dark Leatherback turtles weigh around 600kg 95st and their shells can be up to two metres 6ft 7in long The shell is flexible and covered in a black leathery skin hence the name leatherback Last August thousands of leatherback eggs and hatchlings were crushed by bulldozers moving waterlogged sand from key nesting areas", "Every society has topics it does not discuss These are the issues which challenge its comfortable assumptions They are the ones that remind us of mortality which threaten the continuity we anticipate which expose our various beliefs as irreconcilable Among them are the facts which sink the cosy assertion that in David Cameron s words there need not be a tension between green and growth At a reception in London recently I met an extremely rich woman who lives as most people with similar levels of wealth do in an almost comically unsustainable fashion jetting between various homes and resorts in one long turbo charged holiday When I told her what I did she responded Oh I agree the environment is so important I m crazy about recycling But the real problem she explained was people breeding too much I agreed that population is an element of the problem but argued that consumption is rising much faster and unlike the growth in the number of people is showing no signs of levelling off She found this notion deeply offensive I mean the notion that human population growth is slowing When I told her that birth rates are dropping almost everywhere and that the world is undergoing a slow demographic transition she disagreed violently she has seen on her endless travels how many children all those people have As so many in her position do she was using population as a means of disavowing her own impacts The issue allowed her to transfer responsibility to others people at the opposite end of the economic spectrum It allowed her to pretend that her shopping and flying and endless refurbishments of multiple homes are not a problem Recycling and population these are the amulets people clasp in order not to see the clash between protecting the environment and rising consumption In a similar way we have managed with the help of a misleading global accounting system to overlook one of the gravest impacts of our consumption This too has allowed us to blame foreigners particularly poorer foreigners for the problem When nations negotiate global cuts in greenhouse gas emissions they are held responsible only for the gases produced within their own borders Partly as a result of this convention these tend to be the only ones that countries count When these territorial emissions fall they congratulate themselves on reducing their carbon footprints But as markets of all kinds have been globalised and as manufacturing migrates from rich nations to poorer ones territorial accounting bears ever less relationship to our real impacts While this is an issue which affects all post industrial countries it is especially pertinent in the United Kingdom where the difference between our domestic and international impacts is greater than that of any other major emitter The last government boasted that this country cut greenhouse gas emissions by 19 between 1990 and 2008 It positioned itself as the current government does as a global leader on course to meet its own targets and as an example for other nations to follow But the cut the UK has celebrated is an artefact of accountancy When the impact of the goods we buy from other nations is counted our total greenhouse gases did not fall by 19 between 1990 and 2008 They rose by 20 This is despite the replacement during that period of many of our coal fired power stations with natural gas which produces roughly half as much carbon dioxide for every unit of electricity When our consumption emissions rather than territorial emissions are taken into account our proud record turns into a story of dismal failure There are two further impacts of this false accounting The first is that because many of the goods whose manufacture we commission are now produced in other countries those places take the blame for our rising consumption We use China just as we use the population issue as a means of deflecting responsibility What s the point of cutting our own consumption a thousand voices ask when China is building a new power station every 10 seconds or whatever the current rate happens to be But just as our position is flattered by the way greenhouse gases are counted China s is unfairly maligned A graph published by the House of Commons energy and climate change committee shows that consumption accounting would reduce China s emissions by roughly 45 Many of those power stations and polluting factories have been built to supply our markets feeding an apparently insatiable demand in the UK the US and other rich nations for escalating quantities of stuff The second thing the accounting convention has hidden from us is consumerism s contribution to global warming Because we consider only our territorial emissions we tend to emphasise the impact of services heating lighting and transport for example while overlooking the impact of goods Look at the whole picture however and you discover using the Guardian s carbon calculator that manufacturing and consumption is responsible for a remarkable 57 of the greenhouse gas production caused by the UK Unsurprisingly hardly anyone wants to talk about this as the only meaningful response is a reduction in the volume of stuff we consume And this is where even the most progressive governments climate policies collide with everything else they represent As Mustapha Mond points out in Brave New World industrial civilisation is only possible when there s no self denial Self indulgence up to the very limits imposed by hygiene and economics Otherwise the wheels stop turning The wheels of the current economic system which depends on perpetual growth for its survival certainly The impossibility of sustaining this system of endless pointless consumption without the continued erosion of the living planet and the future prospects of humankind is the conversation we will not have By considering only our territorial emissions we make the impacts of our escalating consumption disappear in a puff of black smoke we have offshored the problem and our perceptions of it But at least in a couple of places the conjuring trick is beginning to attract some attention On 16 April the Carbon Omissions site will launch a brilliant animation by Leo Murray neatly sketching out the problem The hope is that by explaining the issue simply and engagingly his animation will reach a much bigger audience than articles like the one you are reading can achieve Declaration of interest unpaid I did the voiceover On 24 April the Committee on Climate Change a body that advises the UK government will publish a report on how consumption emissions are likely to rise and how government policy should respond to the issue I hope this is the beginning of a conversation we have been avoiding for much too long How many of us are prepared fully to consider the implications www monbiot com", "The Nobel Prize won by British scientist Francis Crick for his discovery of DNA has sold for 2 27m 1 47m at auction in New York It was bought by Jack Wang CEO of a Shanghai based biomedical firm who had flown in specially for the sale Professor Crick won the prize in 1962 for his discovery of the structure of the DNA molecule making it possible to decode how living beings function It was one of 10 lots put up for sale by Crick s heirs On Wednesday a letter written by Crick describing for his 12 year old son his discovery of the double helix shape of DNA sold for 5 3m far exceeding its estimate The sales will in part benefit scientific research Much of the bidding at Thursday s auction happened remotely by telephone and internet but Jack Wang was so determined to buy the Nobel Prize medal that he flew in from California and was prepared to offer double what he ended up paying reports the BBC s Barbara Plett from New York He said he was looking for ways to encourage research into his own company s technology It s all about this excitement around science We re going to form a committee and then judge which scientists have contributed to new technology and then we re going to pass that medal and diploma to the winner said Mr Wang Crick discovered the structure of DNA along with two other scientists James Watson and Maurice Wilkins We have found the secret of life he announced in a Cambridge pub in 1962 All three later received the Nobel prize for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material His granddaughter Kendra said the family decided to sell the medal and other of his possessions in part to raise money for scientific research and was overwhelmed by the result It s all about this excitement around science and if it can inspire anyone I m sure that would make him very happy she said This is only the second time that a Nobel medal has been sold in public auction Part of the proceeds will go to fund a new medical research institute in London named in honour of Francis Crick", "At the top of the hill above Woodgreen we turn into the woods with little expectation April diaries in past years all speak of emerging spring colour but this year the season is a bride running late The banks along the roadside are bare The woodland floor scuffs and crackles as bone dry leaves and bracken are trodden down It s hard to find any breaking buds Bluebells are through the ground but only weakly Some more advanced than most have been eaten off In clearer areas patches of foxgloves are awaiting warmer days and more sunlight to trigger their pent up growth Smallish logs have been turned over the ground beneath scratched away Another more rotten trunk has simply been torn apart Is this the work of a badger perhaps with recently born cubs to be fed A circle of plucked wood pigeon feathers suggests an unwary bird has become the victim of a sparrow hawk but there are no remains of its body to be seen Maybe they were eagerly taken by ravenous badger or fox Smaller bushes and trees have lost their over wintering buds A pile of shiny black pointed droppings reveals that roe deer feed here and have probably found meagre fare in them Without doubt winter has extended its reach and the evidence is all about But there are other signs Wood ants have emerged from their deeply buried nests and huddle in threatening masses around the entrances Not many are out scouting for food nor will they find much until the temperatures increase and the insect population begins to explode Then they will become one of the woodland s major predators vying with the birds to find the caterpillars to feed their young First though they will rebuild their nests above ground to give both ventilation and temperature control Not far from the ants we did find our first flowers In among a stand of silver birches stunted hairy leaved wood rushes are just coming into flower their brown florets almost concealed by the mosses with which they are living We pause high above the River Avon to admire the view across the valley towards the red roofs of Breamore Mill and the rich winter twiggery of distant golden willows Real colour at last"]
