of Fair Trading The OFT wants to find out if the games put undue pressure on children to pay for additional content Many games ask players to pay to get coins gems or other virtual items to speed their progress through levels The OFT wants to hear from parents who have seen firms aggressively pushing in game content to children The investigation comes alongside media reports about children spending large sums on virtual items for smartphone and web games In March five year old schoolboy Danny Kitchen from Bristol managed to rack up charges of more than 1 700 while playing the Zombies versus Ninjas game on his parents iPad The money has since been refunded by Apple The BBC s Technology correspondent Rory Cellan Jones explains some of the things you can do to prevent charges from web and phone games In January this year regulator PhonePayPlus revealed it had seen a 300 increase in complaints from consumers about the bills generated when they buy add ons for games and other apps In its investigation the OFT wants to find out if the games are misleading commercially aggressive or otherwise unfair when they give people the chance to buy extras It also wants to find out if children are being specifically targeted by such applications We are concerned that children and their parents could be subject to unfair pressure to purchase when they are playing games they thought were free but which can actually run up substantial costs said Cavendish Elithorn the OFT s senior director for goods and consumer Makers of games that strongly encourage children to buy or pressure them to ask parents to buy on their behalf could be breaking laws on fair trading said the OFT Mr Elithorn said the OFT did not want to ban in game purchases but wanted to be sure that games makers are complying with relevant laws Consumer groups or parents with evidence of games aggressively marketing in game extras should contact the OFT it said Figures gathered by the OFT reveal that the vast majority of the most popular smartphone games were free to install but raised cash for their creators via in app purchases Such extras were priced very differently it said with some costing only a few pence but the most high priced were 70", "On the show this week Editor of the Guardian s Datablog Simon Rogers joins Charles Arthur and Jemima Kiss to discuss his new book Facts Are Sacred and the

false navigation information to a simulated jet that made it change course Mr Teso built his simulator using spare parts from real jets for sale on the eBay auction site Authorities say actual flight computers are not compromised by his work but want to find out more The loopholes in the flight management system were detailed by Mr Teso during a presentation to the Hack In The Box conference in Amsterdam Mr Teso who is also a qualified commercial pilot said he had spent the past four years investigating the many different computer and data systems found on aircraft which help them fly and navigate safely I expected them to have security issues but I did not expect them to be so easy to spot he said I thought I would have to fight hard to get into them but it was not that difficult Mr Teso set out to find a way to subvert the flight management systems FMS found on many different aircraft He planned to feed them fake or booby trapped data via well known radio communication systems Old aviation equipment was bought via eBay to help Mr Teso interrogate the code these systems ran This hardware was used to build a simulated aircraft that ran many of the systems found on commercial aircraft and could swap data via radio with the air traffic and navigation systems used in the real world The lab work produced an attack toolkit that could influence the FMS of the simulated aircraft as it was in flight I can influence the guidance and navigation of the aircraft he told the BBC adding that the system had limitations It requires some careful planning and timing to achieve results he said Despite this he said publicity about the talk had led the European Aviation and Safety Agency EASA and the US Federal Aviation Administration to get in touch seeking more details Now he said Mr Teso and n runs the German security company he works for are setting up meetings to pass on his findings In a statement EASA said it was aware of Mr Teso s work and presentation This presentation was based on a PC training simulator and did not reveal potential vulnerabilities on actual flying systems it said There are major differences between a PC based training FMS software and an embedded FMS software The version used on flight desks was hardened to avoid many of the loopholes found in the training systems it added Mr Teso said there was little risk that malicious hackers would be able to use what he found You would have to have solid knowledge of aviation and its protocols and that s not easy to get he said adding that he planned to keep on with the research He said there were lots of other approach vectors for hacking aircraft systems", "By Matthew Sparkes 12 53PM BST 12 Apr 2013 Comments Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss the brothers who sued Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for 140million alleging that he stole the idea for elements of the social network from them claim to have as much as 11million invested or had as the last two days have seen a dramatic popping of the bitcoin bubble The New York Times reports that as of Thursday morning they had 11 million worth of bitcoins At the time the intangible assets were trading for around 120 giving the former Olympic rowers an estimated holding of around 92 000 bitcoins Since then they have fallen to 77 meaning that the pair s investment has taken a serious hit But the news may not be as bad as it seems they are reported to have begun buying last summer when bitcoins were still trading for just a few US dollars each The currency has seen a huge bubble in recent weeks rising from around 10 at the start of the year to a peak above 260 on April 10 The rise has been put down to the economic troubles in Cyprus online retailers begining to accept bitcoin as payment and a general increase in public awareness But in the last two days there has been a dramatic correction with prices slumping to around 77 As well as this dizzying volatility investors have had to deal with highly unstable trading platforms an unfortunate symptom of a new and decentralised currency Mt Gox one of the earliest bitcoin exchanges which currently handles more than half of all trades was forced to go offline for 12 hours yesterday to upgrade its infrastructure because of soaring volume Bitcoin trading halted after panic sell off Bitcoin slumps more than 40pc falls back below 200 Bitcoin the new gold but what on earth is it Russians most interested in Bitcoin searches show Some say this was the result of hackers staging a DDoS distributed denial of service attack where lots of spurious requests are sent to a website to bring it to its knees while others say it s a result of exponentially increasing trading activity as people pour into the goldrush then subsequently panic at price fluctuations and try to pull out their investment Both are likely true A post on the Mt Gox blog claimed the site had been a victim of its own success after the number of trades tripled in the 24 hours to 2am on April 11 The number of new accounts opened in the first few days of April had reached 75 000 more than the 60 000 speculators who signed up in the whole month of March Speculating on bitcoin is just the latest in a string of online ventures for the Winkelvosses since their involvement with Facebook They have set up shop as venture capitalists and put money into a shopping website called Hukkster and an online community for money managers SumZero But their significant investment in bitcoin will be taken by many as a sign that the bubble bursting will prove to be just a blip on an otherwise upward trajectory People say it s a Ponzi scheme it s a bubble Cameron Winklevoss told The New York Times People really don t want to take it seriously At some point that narrative will shift to virtual currencies are here to stay We re in the early days We have elected to put our money and faith in a mathematical framework that is free of politics and human error said his brother Tyler Despite their faith the future of bitcoin looks as unpredictable as its recent history has been volatile Currently there are around 11million bitcoins in circulation with new ones created by mining where powerful computers crunch data to bring new currency into existence This is essentially busy work without practical purpose but it guarantees that new coins aren t created too quickly The system is designed so that this process becomes increasingly difficult until in 2040 a finite limit of 21million coins is reached As well as recent high profile investors such as the Winklevosses there are many early adopters who began mining bitcoins near the system s launch in 2009 who are likely to be sitting on similarly large sums of the digital currency But the brother s announcement makes them the largest public investors to date Unlike traditional currencies which can be safely held in a range of investment funds or banks bitcoins are essentially little more than computer files which need to be stored locally on the owner s computer or in an online repository Both have their own security problems and since the market is entirely unregulated nobody is protected from losses so the Winklevoss brothers have reportedly taken their holdings saved them on USB flash drives and stashed them in safe deposit boxes in three different cities", "By Louisa Peacock 5 20PM BST 12 Apr 2013 Comments Foster

up a mental image of one of the most divisive individuals in software Clippy was the office assistant introduced into Microsoft s Office suite in 1997 The hopeful little wire character provoked an almost universal outpouring of hatred from users The company bowed to the inevitable in 2003 and sent Clippy to the great paper clip tidy in the sky But despite the loathing felt for the feature it had little effect on the seemingly unstoppable march of Office into homes and businesses globally Today one in seven us one billion people use Office whether at work or at home It s a 24bn business which accounts for a third of Microsoft s revenue The man in charge is Kurt DelBene and it s a challenge he obviously relishes You don t have a job like mine or the people of my team unless you get excited everyday about envisioning what the future looks like for people and how they express themselves he says Office has been around since 1989 and was originally composed of Word spreadsheet application Excel and the progenitor of a million Thursday afternoon office presentations PowerPoint It has since expanded to include email client Outlook OneNote for note taking unified communications application Lync and much more The current versions are Office 2013 and Office 365 their cloud based subscription service That s not to say that there aren t pretenders to Microsoft s crown business specialists like Cisco and SAP open source options like OpenOffice and not least Google Apps The service is cloud based so is accessible from most devices and the most basic level free So is the push to the cloud a reaction to competition from Google and other cloud based applications Actually not very much says Mr DelBene We look at where we think the industry is going I think we tend to think in terms of opportunities rather than threats When it s a competitive environment it forces us to do our best work And I think it sharpens your skills We respect our competitors but we think we have a different perspective Offering software via subscription rather than selling consumers a package outright is becoming increasingly common and it s a model Mr DelBene thinks will stick This doesn t mean that it always meets with customer approval however When Office 2013 launched earlier this year the company came in for some hefty criticism Those who wanted to buy the software found they could install it on only one machine And when that machine died so did Office Many felt they were being pressured into moving to the subscription model The company swiftly backtracked We changed that because we did get feedback from customers that it was not well received says Mr DelBene We ll continue to provide the perpetual versions of our products as long as there is demand for it Nevertheless he maintains that most customers will move towards the subscription service to access regular updates The Home version lets you install Office on up to five machines with a scaled price plan for business But should you cancel your subscription after a series of warnings you will only be able to read documents rather than edit or create them The company bought the business social network Yammer in 2012 and recently announced plans to integrate it more closely with Office and Sharepoint their collaboration tool Yammer Enterprise now comes packaged with the business version of Office 365 The suite is also designed to be used with touch screens although Mr DelBene concedes that it could be some time before companies are replacing their desktops with touchscreen computers It s obviously no coincidence that Microsoft launched their own tablet computer in 2012 the Surface But what if you re an Apple fan Office still isn t available for iPad and other iOS devices There are a variety of apps by third parties that go some way to plugging the gap Microsoft have created an app for OneNote but other than this users are forced to rely on web versions which don t work offline For now this is unlikely to change according to Mr DelBene I think what you ll see is a continued investment in web applications as a way of working well on an iPad working well on an Android tablet etc On the future he refuses to be drawn We haven t announced anything at this point he says If a recently leaked document is correct iPad owners may have to wait until 2014 This has caused some to speculate that the company is making a costly tactical error pointing to disappointing sales of the Surface Whether this will give the Surface time to play catch up or whether some iPad users will stop using Office remains to be seen Looking forward Mr DelBene is focusing on better data management We live in a web of information and in some sense I should be able to use that web more effectively to start the authoring process and to express myself moving forward as well He also sees change coming in the types of devices we use at work I think natural interfaces via touch via voice will continue to be important I think we will very quickly get to a place where people can have meetings but all of us are not in the same room yet it feels like we all are because with a few inexpensive cameras we can re image you in the meeting as if you were here As for Clippy things are looking up Following his ignominious fall from grace in 2003 he was resurrected from Silicon Heaven

Skoltech have set up the first Center for Research Education and Innovation CREI to position both countries as leaders in stem cell technology There will be strong financial support for the CREI from the Russian government to commercialise the considerable opportunities from biomedical research Fifteen of these five year long research projects will be founded by 2020 and possess a cumulative budget of 675 million The US will also participate through a sub contract to the Whitehead Institute in Groningen in a global effort to accelerate the commercialisation of stem cell science which is one of the fastest developing and promising fields in biomedicine The 2012 Nobel Prize was awarded for the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent stem cells by scientists in Japan and the UK and Skoltech has engaged one of the world s leading experts in cancer and molecular genetics to oversee the project At Skoltech we are building a university from the ground up in a unique way dedicated to translating research to real impact in the commercial world We have convinced a world leader in the field to move to Moscow to start the Center and we are really excited to have attracted him said Edward Crawley President of Skoltech Stem cells help paraplegics regain feeling Stem cells could be used to make biological pacemaker for heart patients First trial of human stem cell therapy in blind patients works Stem cells from blood may banish wrinkles Stem cells from patient s blood could help fight heart disease The Center will also bring to Moscow leading international researchers in the field to conduct courses and training for industry faculty and researchers Previously these individuals would have had no other recourse but to search for expertise outside of the country The Skoltech Center for Stem Cell Research will focus on using stem cells to address liver diseases cancer aging and current incurable diseases by creating transplantable stem cells from induced pluripotent cells and developing specific cellular systems The Center will also work with many of the 800 start up companies that are based at the Skolkovo Park in Moscow to create marketable products Currently there is not a single Russian university in the world s Top 200 universities and Skoltech is a major project to address this The creation of the Skolkovo campus at the Skolkovo Park in a partnership with Boston s MIT and international deals of this nature are expected to push Russia into this elite within five years The academic tie up with the Netherlands follows recent Russian commercial partnerships with corporations such as Cisco IBM Siemens and Rosneft that have all invested in Skolkovo These blue chip companies were recently joined at the end of 2012 by Samsung who signed an agreement to set up a R D centre in Moscow", "Last week Nissan began production of the first UK built electric car the Leaf at its plant in Sunderland The company believes that after a slow start the time has finally come for the battery operated electric car Electric vehicles are seen by governments as an important part of cutting emissions and reducing global warming After all what comes out of the car is completely clean but nonetheless some scientists are questioning their green credentials Concerns are focused on two areas One recent study by scientists in EV friendly Norway has found that in some circumstances electric cars can have a greater impact on global warming than conventional cars One of the authors of the report at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology Guillaume Majeau Bettez admits that he is shocked and disappointed that their findings are not more positive for EVs The electric car has great potential for improvement but ultimately what will make it a success or failure from an environmental standpoint is how much we can clean up our electricity grid both for the electricity you use when you drive your car and for the electricity used for producing the car The study is a life cycle analysis of the global warming impact of the production and operation of EVs driven for 150 000km 93 750 miles compared with the production and operation of conventional cars The scientists include so called well to wheel data taking into account the energy needed to refine and transport oil into petrol or diesel One of the findings is that the energy intensive manufacturing of EVs mean that some cars make almost double the impact on global warming as conventional cars This is mostly because of the raw materials and energy needed to build the lithium ion batteries However the moment a new EV hits the road the environmental picture starts to improve I m sitting at the lights in my borrowed plastic car waiting for the red to go green In the next lane a white van man eyes my itsy bitsy teeny weeny two seater and revs with intent I try to gun my motor in reply only to raise a faint hum A sewing machine on wheels would sound more impressive But I show him when the lights change Small and silent as the car is it accelerates like a dream until I m brought up short by gridlocked lunchtime traffic The car is a Ford Think on loan to the environmental group Future Forests as part of a trial in London However even here the picture is mixed and wholly dependent on how electricity is generated in the country the car is being driven in It can even depend on what time of day the batteries are charged because night time electricity is less dependent on coal In the UK during 2012 electricity generation from coal fired power stations actually increased to almost 40 of total production as the price of gas soared and gas fired electricity generation was reduced Electricity from coal which is the most polluting way to generate power drastically reduces the environmental advantage for EVs Because China for example generates almost all its power from coal life cycle analysis of EV cars in China shows they are far more polluting than conventional cars However in a country like Norway where most power is generated from hydroelectricity EVs fairly quickly begin to outperform conventional cars in terms of their overall environmental impact Majeau Bettez explains it thus For a European average power generation mix and if you use your car for 150 000km you could hope for a 25 improvement in global warming impact relative to a gasoline car It seems that the UK has a more intensive coal and natural gas mix so the benefits would be somewhat less than that The authors do not analyse individual countries but Majeau Bettez estimates that the global warming impact of an EV car driven in the UK is about 10 better over its life cycle than that of a car with an internal combustion engine This picture should improve as the UK reduces its dependency on coal According to the Department for Energy and Climate Change by 2020 it is estimated that coal will provide only 11 of electricity However projections remain unclear because of rising gas prices and uncertainty over a new generation of nuclear power stations Nissan which has invested 420m in Sunderland to build a new version of the Leaf is confident that the argument will swing in favour of electric vehicles We talk about ordinary combustion engine vehicles in terms of tail pipe emissions says John Martin head of European manufacturing and if we compare tail pipe emissions from an EV they are zero They re 100 less than an internal combustion engine car But on electricity generation you are right 40 of the electricity generated in the UK uses coal But the fact is that we know that mix is changing as we phase out coal fired power stations and replace them with gas And if everything goes to plan we ll be increasing the nuclear mix as well It is also hoped that as EVs become less niche just 2 237 were registered in the UK last year a mere 0 1 of total car sales greater volume production will make the manufacturing process more efficient It all makes the choice for consumers of whether to switch to an EV a difficult and complicated one Aside from questions about their driving range and whether you will get to your destination without having to charge the battery the environmental benefits are not always clear And some research also has to be scrutinised carefully because oil companies are accused of funding pseudo scientific reports aimed at doing down the EV market The Norwegian study has been criticised by some for example because of links between the university and the oil company Statoil However the team behind the research insist that no oil money was used to fund their research They have also published all their data online for public scrutiny We want people to make choices with their eyes open knowing the trade offs says Majeau Bettez There have been rather a high number of misrepresentations from all sides in this debate There is no such thing as a zero emission anything whether a zero emission vehicle or a zero emission building Everything has emissions but sometimes they are just further away from the user You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook", "Lighting company Philips has developed an LED lamp that it describes as the world s most energy efficient It said the prototype tube lighting LED is twice as efficient as those currently used in offices and industry around the world but offers the same amount of light Being able to halve the amount of energy used could bring huge cost and energy savings Lighting accounts for more than 19 of global electricity consumption The prototype tube lighting produces 200 lumens per watt 200lm W compared with 100lm W for equivalent strip lighting and 15lm W for traditional light bulbs Light emitting diodes have been around for years Traditionally they have been used as indicators on electrical devices such as standby lights on TVs This was because LEDs were available only in red but recent advances mean that other colours are now available and the light emitted is much brighter White light used for general lighting using LEDs can be created via a number of techniques One example is mixing red green and blue LEDs It is suggested that LEDs can last for up to 100 000 hours compared with the 1 000 hours of traditional incandescent light bulbs and compact fluorescent lamps CFLs 15 000 hours The technology is also much more energy efficient using up to 90 less energy than incandescent bulbs The long lifespans and low energy use make LEDs economically attractive because even though the fittings cost more the running and maintenance bills are lower This is a major breakthrough in LED lighting and will further drive the transformation of the lighting industry said Rene van Schooten chief executive of light source and electronics at Philips It s exciting to imagine the massive energy and cost savings it will bring to our planet and customers he added The lamps are intended to replace the fluorescent tube lighting used in offices and industry which currently account for more than half of the world s total lighting In the US for example such lighting consumes around 200 terawatts of electricity annually Swapping to the energy efficient lamps could save 12bn 7 8bn and stop 60 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere according to Philips LED light bulbs are more efficient than traditional incandescent ones because there is less energy loss through heat However they tend to be more expensive than ordinary light bulbs Philips expects the light to go on the market in 2015 initially to replace office lighting Ultimately though it is seen as a real alternative to lighting in the home The company has not yet published prices but a spokesperson told the BBC that the cost would not be significantly more than current LED tube lights The Energy Saving Trust a UK charity which provides advice on how to cut carbon emissions said manufacturers claims always had to be treated with caution but added that if Philips could bring the product to market it would represent a major advance The typical performance of LEDs we have trialled and tested before has typically been in the range of 50 to 70 lumens per watt which is significantly better than traditional lighting so if this new Philips product can perform as claimed then it represents a huge leap forward in performance James Russill the trust s technical development manager told the BBC It is also good that this product is aimed at office environments where lighting is often left on for 24 hours per day the potential for reducing electricity demand is therefore very high", "By Victoria Lambert 8 34PM BST 11 Apr 2013 Comments Haven t the Easter holidays gone on this year Looking down the garden three small girls still sewn into their thermals are trying to teach three recalcitrant guinea pigs tricks At least they are not trying to get their pets to mate as my sisters and I did unfortunately witnessed by the local RSPCA rep who promptly expelled us from the junior branch But I can sense these eight year old friends are getting bored and any minute will come hurtling into my study breaking my dammit train of thought dammit again Still I shouldn t wish them back to school For so long I thought I d never have a child to buy

was eligible for NHS treatment having suffered three previous miscarriages the qualifying condition Powdered eggs could be new IVF solution Professor Sir Robert Edwards More IVF for gay and older couples Young women having IVF at higher risk of breast cancer Fertility boosting drugs linked to childhood cancer IVF women given fresh hope Where I was truly fortunate was timing Had I been born a few years earlier I would have missed out on the influence of Prof Sir Robert Edwards the pioneer of in vitro fertilisation IVF who died two days ago When I was born in 1965 Edwards then a young Cambridge academic had begun innovative work in the labs at Churchill College By 1968 he had fertilised a human egg in a Petri dish and started to work with Patrick Steptoe the Lancashire gynaecologist who was exploring ways to remove unfertilised eggs from patients using new keyhole surgery Ten years later when I was 13 and learning about yuck human reproduction at school their collaboration led to the birth of Louise Brown the world s first test tube baby Edwards and Steptoe s work has led to an astonishing surge in pregnancy rates among women previously written off often with little compassion as barren Some five million children have been born by IVF worldwide But advances in reproductive medicine didn t stop at test tube babies From that single piece of work have blossomed astonishing developments in reproductive medicine One couple s egg and sperm mixing in a Petri dish is nothing these days compared to pregnancies achieved through egg or sperm donation artificial implantation and ovarian stimulation Even Aldous Huxley didn t foresee a time when embryos could be tested for potentially fatal diseases before they hit the womb Then there is ICSI intracytoplasmic sperm injection where a woman with a steady hand can suck up a sleepy sperm using a pipette and inject it into a healthy looking egg More remarkable still was an operation I witnessed in St Louis when a surgeon took a slice of an infertile young man s testicular tissue and gently probed it to find one single live sperm Embryology is a career choice in 2013 IVF doctors are two a penny and worth a million So Prof Edwards s technique didn t just spawn a baby it created a new reproductive industry His work was a game changer for women like me But it was never absolute In trying for a sibling at 41 I turned to the armoury of help I knew was out there I took one of the fertility drugs developed to support IVF but two years later had to admit defeat as no baby followed The technique devised by Prof Edwards was brilliant worthy of his Nobel prize but never divine Yet parents everywhere will mourn him this week Not just for what he did but for what he made possible Even

its business were made following talks with European Commission competition regulators Since November 2010 Brussels has been looking into Google s search business following complaints from rivals Google said it was continuing to co operate with the Commission investigation The anti trust investigation was kicked off by rivals such as Microsoft as well as mapping firms and web retailers which said the way Google ran its search business made it hard for them to compete fairly In a statement Antoine Colombani the Commission spokesman on competition policy said it had completed its preliminary assessment a few weeks ago and had told Google of its concerns This he said had prompted Google to submit a formal proposal to the Commission about what it would do to change the way it operated By making formal proposals Google hopes to head off potentially huge fines Among the measures Google is believed to have offered to label its services to make it more obvious to people what they are using and to make it easier for people to use rival advertising services the Reuters news agency reports The proposals will now be subjected to a market test to gauge the response of rivals

Ms Hoang who had been seeking 1m 650 000 in damages had initially provided the site with a false birth year that reduced her stated age by seven years When she asked for that information to be removed

creating an account for themselves and one for their animals After that they are free to post news photos and videos Particularly cute animals are featured on the homepage in pictures or the video of the day The website is not breaking entirely new ground however Catmoji a social network exclusively for cats launched on Christmas Eve last year On a more serious note charities are also using the website to find new homes for abandoned pets The website is also open to businesses that cater to pet owners Dogs end cats reign in pet battle Dog helps puppy conquer fear of stairs It can be a dog s life in the office Miracle dog learns to walk again My Social Petwork s layout has a lot in common with Pinterest where users can pin content they like to their pinboard As you might expect both websites are heavily focused on pictures With about 16 million cats and dogs in the UK the social network has a big potential market for expansion One in ten owners upload pictures of their pets online at least once a week research for the website found Catriona Golden Digital Project Manager at PEP Publishing which owns the website said With millions of pet owners posting pictures videos and updates about their pets on to their social media channels every week My Social Petwork is the UK s first social networking site to give pet owners of all breeds and species the chance to come together in one place to share their pictures videos and updates and make friends with other like minded pet owners", "Next month there will be a TEDxCERN event We ll also be linking to it with an event at UCL and one of my colleagues is speaking about Planck data Such events aren t without their critics There are many excellent TED and TEDx talks out there well delivered well produced and applauded by well heeled audiences However this in itself lends authority to the occasional fraudster or fruit loop who may slip through But well surely the point is to think not to accept a thought because of the platform on which it has been presented It s reasonable to expect those who control access to such platforms to exercise some editorial judgement But it is unreasonable to expect them to be perfect and it is always unwise to disengage your own critical faculties For example if you turn up to do an experiment in an undergraduate laboratory you might expect the script that comes with the experiment to be accurate It has a certain authority However when you do a real research experiment to find out something no one knew before there is no script So what do students learn from following scripts Well you can learn techniques How to operate equipment how to read off results how to structure an experiment But if in the process you also learn to blindly follow recipes that is a big unwelcome side effect One way around this is to plant surprises in the the scripts They become unreliable guides and you have to keep critical faculties alert while following them or they may lead you up the garden path or up some kind of noxious creek This is great since it is not only a much better preparation for real physics and life I think but is more fun Paul Bartlett actually won an award for introducing this at UCL Still the scripts have to be mostly reliable otherwise everyone wastes too much time Similarly access to platforms requires at least an attempt at filtering out obvious nonsense Topically speaking you might say that giving a platform to a struck off and thoroughly discredited ex Doctor is completely rubbish and I would agree But what about a Nobel laureate retired professor of physics from Cambridge University Safe enough to switch off your critical faculties Well I d watch out for this one It is reasonable even inevitable that we lend credence to people based on context or past performance But in the end it really is a loan And credit worthiness can decline as well as rise This applies to the gate keepers as well as those they let through Anyway back to TEDxCERN I recommend this TED Ed lesson on cosmology and particle physics from Tom Whyntie as a good taster for the May event He has a PhD in particle physics dammit But also the animation reminds me a bit of the small guy in the Pink Panther And to be frank of Tom Jon Butterworth is a scientist so he must be right Except perhaps sometimes on twitter where he bangs on as

young people are falling foul of aggressive tactics introduced to get them to pay for added extras Manufacturers could face fines for providing misleading information and be forced to repackage downloads as part of a new drive designed to stop children being ripped off Currently thousands of games are available to be downloaded to smartphones and tablet computers free of charge But users are normally interrupted with adverts for inapp purchases covering extra levels add on features and virtual currency such as coins gems or fruit How to stop child s play landing you with a giant bill In app charging five horror stories How to avoid costly iPad bills Five year old runs up 1 700 iPad bill in ten minutes Schoolboy six leaves family with 2000 iPad game bill Boy runs up 1 000 bill buying virtual doughnuts on iPad Figures suggest that eight out of 10 of the most popular games are now free to install but raise revenue through paid for extras with single purchases ranging from a few pence to more than 70 But the OFT claim that children are particularly vulnerable to the trend as they increasingly access the internet without parental supervision Earlier this year a five year old boy racked up a bill of 1 700 playing a free game on an iPad Danny Kitchen from Warmley near Bristol asked his father for a password to play the Zombies vs Ninja game but then bought dozens of add ons without re entering the password over a 15 minute period In a further example an eight year old boy ran up a bill of almost 1 000 buying virtual doughnuts while playing Tapped Out an iPad game based on The Simpsons television series Cavendish Elithorn OFT senior director for goods and consumer said We are concerned that children and their parents could be subject to unfair pressure to purchase when they are playing games they thought were free but which can actually run up substantial costs The OFT is not seeking to ban in game purchases but the games industry must ensure it is complying with the relevant regulations so that children are protected We are speaking to the industry and will take enforcement action if necessary According to officials the OFT will investigate how companies providing free web or app based games market their products to children Parents and consumer groups will be asked to contact the watchdog with information about potentially misleading or commercially aggressive practices in relation to these games The OFT action will look into whether games include direct exhortations to children a strong encouragement to make a purchase which would be illegal under consumer protection legislation A breach carries a maximum 5 000 fine or two years prison It will also investigate whether children were made aware of the full cost of these games when they were initially downloaded The OFT expects to publish its next steps by October 2013", "By Monty Munford 7 00AM BST 14 Apr 2013 How important is mobile to advertising as a whole Millennial Media was founded almost seven years ago and after working at Verizon Wireless for five years I had a first hand view into the impact mobile devices were making on consumer behavior That shift was the inspiration to build a mobile advertising company that would help marketers and developers publishers realise the value of mobile Many companies have had to shift their business models to become more mobile but in the case of Millennial Media we ve been solely focused on mobile since the beginning and that has allowed us to build a robust data and technology platform that lets us succeed in this ecosystem What is the App Economy The App Economy represents the ecosystem of mobile apps that is driving forward the mobile revolution we are currently experiencing Twitter ad revenue to hit 1bn next year Facebook mobile adverts expected in March 2012 Google shares climb as stems ad price decline Apple iPhone and Google Android users irritated by mobile ads Apps are an easy intuitive and interactive way to instantly deliver content on mobile devices and they have changed the way users gather information consume media shop interact with their friends and much more Going forward the apps on a consumer s home screen will essentially serve as their own personal portal of content uniquely suited to their particular interests Advertisers have found great value in reaching consumers through this new App Economy which has provided developers with a business model that will let them grow and continue producing great content for consumers using mobile devices How do you target customers Our Mobile Audience Solutions represent a type of targeting we can offer advertisers that allows them to reach specific consumer audiences ranging from Mums with Young Kids to Avid Readers We build these audiences by analysing volumes of data that we receive from more than 39 000 sites and apps on our platform which have our software embedded The data we analyse includes location data social data interest data and demographic data and it is the combination of all of these that allows us to gain a unique multi dimensional view of individual profiles that we call our Relevance Graph Location data in particular is incredibly valuable and allows us to gain insights that would not be possible in any other medium For example an online advertiser may determine that a consumer is interested in buying a car because they spent time browsing on various car websites This person may actually be interested in a car but they may also just be a car enthusiast who likes reading about the latest models With our Mobile Audience Solutions we can see the same browsing behavior but we can also combine this with location data that shows the consumer went to three different car lots within the past month giving us a much stronger indication of actual purchase intent You are US focused How important is the UK market Mobile is inherently global Consumers all over the world have made mobile devices an integral part of their day to day lives and as such mobile advertising is a global business Our headquarters are in the US and that is where our initial efforts took place to build out our platform However we ve become significantly more global in the last few years opening our London office in the first half of 2010 and a Singapore office in late 2011 London serves as our central hub for our EMEA business with sales teams in not just London but also Germany and France Going forward the UK will continue to be an incredibly important market for us", "A UK student who has spent two years fighting extradition to the US over a copyright dispute has a new project Former TVShack owner Richard O Dwyer is launching Filmhub a site aiming to put TV and movie enthusiasts in touch with video

Amazon and Lovefilm Speaking to the TorrentFreak website Mr O Dwyer described the site which is still in development as a discovery engine It could be described as a hub to manage everything you re

significant incursions into the music space in the near future in moves that could challenge Spotify Pandora and other independent music services Apple is understood to be preparing a music streaming service that would challenge existing ones such as Spotify and Pandora in the US after reports said that it was close to securing licensing deals with Universal Music and Warner Music two of the three major music labels Negotiations with the third Sony Music are said to be less advanced while there is no indication of independent labels willingness to sign But industry gossip points to a launch of the service perhaps called iRadio later this year That would cement Apple s position in the digital music space where its iTunes Music Store which is ten years old this month already makes it the biggest music retailer in the world Music streaming is a fast growing space where the number of subscribers grew 44 in 2012 to 20m Twitter meanwhile is expected to launch a dedicated product optimised for music being readied by Twitter for launch at this weekend s Coachella music festival where artists including Blur will be playing Twitter Music which is being teased with a holding page is thought to offer users a version of Twitter optimised for music including enhanced player tools supporting Soundcloud and iTunes rich follower tools for favourite bands suggestions and trends and a recommendation service between friends The service has been built by the We Are Hunted team an Australian music discovery and sharing tool quietly acquired by Twitter this year The deal was only announced yesterday with a statement on the We Are Hunted site which said While we are shutting down wearehunted com we will continue to create services that will delight you as part of the Twitter team There s no question that Twitter and music go well together Artists turn to Twitter first to connect with fans and people share and discover new songs and albums every day We can t wait to share what we ve been working on at Twitter you will hear more from us Apple s negotiations with labels were reported by The Verge noting that talks with Sony were less advanced Apple hopes that iRadio as the planned new service had been dubbed will help push download sales by helping users discover new music implying that its Genius recommendation tool and Ping network have not done the job Negotiations have not run smoothly Apple had initially been pushing for a royalty rate of around 6c per 100 streamed songs roughly half what rival service Pandora currently pays Current negotiations have doubled that rate There has been speculation that the basic iRadio service would be free and ad supported and launch at Apple s next developer conference in summer Music analyst Alice Enders said that Twitter Music was unlikely to present any challenge to the mainstream commercial music space It is not a game changer it s niche a recommendation based service for people that aren t representative of the billions of people that consume music she said A commission based system for sales on a third party site would be an unlikely revenue stream she said because it would drive users off the Twitter platform so further promotional advertising products are the most likely revenue streams for the service But Apple s service was most likely to present a challenge to Pandora the online radio service that now claims to be used by as much as one third of the US online audience she said The real question is Apple going to attract users away from Pandora said Enders It s a big decision for the recorded music industry whether Apple should become a subscription service noting that the all you can eat service seems to be the nirvana for the music industry even though there is the potential to cannibalise download sales She added that though successful in the US the Pandora model has not achieved that scale in other markets which would limit the potential for an Apple product based on that model Soundcloud declined to comment on Twitter Music and Twitter said it could not comment beyond the statement on We Are Hunted s site Apple did not respond to a request for comment Universal Music made no comment", "I remember the exact moment that it became obvious to me that the very essence of hitchhiking had been transformed by technology It came as we were thundering along the autoroute in the south of France Not one moment of this long day on the road had been spent in the traditional hitching pose waving signs or thumbs at passing motorists Instead I had spent a very pleasant morning back in Barcelona using the latest generation of hitching apps and websites to set up an itinerary of interconnecting rides All I had to do was show up and hop in Now with dusk descending I still hadn t found anywhere to stay despite sending out innumerable requests through websites that connect travellers to kindly folk with floorspace or a couch to spare Then I noticed an icon blinking on my phone Hi this is Emilie in Nice read the message I m happy to host you Call when you get into town A second message followed Hi John I m Karina Emilie s flatmate We re planning a picnic on the beach tonight Perhaps you can come In an instant I d gone from wandering hobo to homecoming friend thanks to the latest online travel innovations It certainly wasn t always like this In the analogue 1980s I took a year off college to hitch around Europe in search of adventure and enlightenment Back then not only did this involve excruciating hours by the roadside it was also downright dangerous with risks ranging from crotch lunges of which I recall a few all the way to serial killers Now rides are simply posted on sites such as BlaBlaCar com Carpooling com and hitchhikers org as well as smartphone apps such as iThumb and Rideshare4less On Twitter they re found using hashtags hitchhike rideshare and autostop Hitchers book a place or post notices saying where they want to go from and to In return all that s expected is a modest contribution to petrol costs or sometimes merely company More importantly drivers can be checked in advance via profiles or reviews from other hitchers making this sort of travel much safer than it used to be After a period of decline in hitchhiking the net is fuelling its resurgence So I downloaded Jack Kerouac s On the Road to my Kindle to keep me company and hit the highways hoping to either recreate my earlier trip in a digital age or just follow where the motorways and websites took me For my maiden voyage I settled on a ride from London to Paris offered on BlaBlaCar by a debonair Parisian named Jean K who according to reviews was de confiance trustworthy As I waited with my luggage at the rendezvous point which Jean insisted on calling Gare de Lewisham I remained unconvinced that the concept would actually work But bang on time up rocked Jean in his Citro n C4 and we were soon blazing as fast as a C4 can blaze through lush French landscapes with Bob Marley pumping from the stereo From Paris my plan was to head towards the Atlantic coast then head south My first ride on this leg via Nantes to the village of Puybelliard in the Vend e region was a rather more soulless affair Then came my first no show Annul annul the driver barked unhelpfully when I called I had to revert to traditional methods An improvised cardboard sign scrawled with La Rochelle SVP worked its magic on a trucker named Olivier and I was soon rolling into this sophisticated old port perched vertiginously in the cockpit of the 18 wheel juggernaut Then in one 343km leap I was in Bayonne a shuttered half timbered riverfront town within easy hitching distance along the coast of the swish resorts of Biarritz and St Jean de Luz By now weary of motorways I was pleased to find online a ride over the Pyrenees to Barcelona bearing a little blue autoroute icon with a strike through meaning that it would mostly be on precipitous B roads The driver who arrived in an explosion of laughter and messy blond hair was an irrepressible force of nature who went by the name of Eglantine On the run after some romantic disaster in Paris she had spent three weeks criss crossing Europe staying in squats on floors and the previous night in a field information she imparted in one heavily accented stream of consciousness in the first few minutes of the journey Once in the mountains we were immediately careering along slivers of swerving tarmac under a crystal blue sky As we crossed the border along the Pas d Aspe barely a crevice in the jagged peaks I looked up to see hovering above the turrets of a chateau that appeared to have been carved into the rock We hurtled into Barcelona at speeds that should have torn Eglantine s juddering Peugeot 205 apart This had definitely been my most exhilarating lift so far A day later I reconvened with Eglantine and her squatter friends to explore the city s Barrio G tico They all extolled the virtues of Couchsurfing org the website that inspired by social networking allows people to offer travellers a room or a sofa for free Until then I had been using paid for accommodation through sites such as Wimdu co uk and had stayed in some enchanting unusual spots a chateau in Puybelliard and a Mongolian yurt near La Rochelle I decided to change tack and got to work completing my Couchsurfing profile and sending out requests But I remained sceptical right up to the moment Emilie s message dropped into my inbox By the time I arrived in Nice the picnic on the beach had been called off but I was soon absorbed into the extended family of this pair of single mothers and avid social networkers Next day I was whisked off to a raucous party in nearby Cagnes sur Mer where a noisy international gang had gathered to feast on Cameroonian cuisine It was with sadness the following morning that I said goodbye to the women and their kids amid promises to meet up in London The next ride took me via Genoa to Florence where an eccentric gentleman named Leonardo had responded to my accommodation request He had turned his modest flat into couchsurfing Grand Central a Polish couple in one room two Chinese in another a pair of Latvians in a tent on the balcony and me in a converted cupboard Next day the Latvians Valdis and Anita and I stuck together We abandoned sightseeing for drinking cheap wine in a park near the Pitti Palace By evening I found myself agreeing to pitch a tent on the banks of the Arno for an illegal bivouac in the heart of Florence I woke to one of the world s most exceptional views the Ponte Vecchio in one direction the Uffizi in the other with the Arno gurgling by just inches away I had hoped to head east Ljubljana Budapest Bratislava but rides never materialised Instead I travelled overnight to Munich through the velvety black outline of the Alps Then it was on to Prague Berlin and Paris and finally back across the Channel I was dropped right on my doorstep in Blackheath south London at 4am In 26 days I had covered 5 759km and taken 21 separate rides The petrol share costs had been 375 making this by far the cheapest way to traverse Europe While some of the sense of adventure is lost if you organise lifts in advance this was still one of the most momentous trips I ve ever taken With two or three hitchers per car it is more social and infinitely safer than the traditional way I m sure that Jack Kerouac would have approved of and used Couchsurfing and the hitching sites had he been around today The age of e thumb has definitely arrived Car sharing costs were covered by BlaBlaCar blablacar com Accommodation was provided by Wimdu wimdu com", "By Rob Grant 1 45PM BST 12 Apr 2013 Comments 1 Will Smith

three six nine or 12 months and then either delete their data or send all or selected elements to a nominated person of their choice The move comes after increasing concern about problems encountered by families who have been trying to access or shut down accounts on sites such as Facebook after the sudden death of relatives and amid controversy over the proposed right to be forgotten that the European Union is trying to introduce over digital information Google s new service joins a number of offerings to handle the aftermath of a digital death typified by services such as Entrustet which let people decide what messages and access to information they want surviving relatives or friends to see after their death With use of social networks becoming prevalent and an important window into peoples lives and friends there have been recent examples of relatives of the dead being unable to gain access to the dead peoples accounts the family of one soldier was refused access to his email by Yahoo and some families have had to seek court orders to gain access to the Facebook accounts of the deceased A spokesperson for Facebook said that the company already offers memorialising services where an account can be kept open but will not be used for advertising Immediate family members can have an account removed completely but they may be required to provide proof of their familial status in addition to proof of death Facebook s spokesperson said But the company is insistent that it will not simply give access to accounts to relatives of the deceased We are only able to consider requests for account contents of a deceased person from an authorised representative The application to obtain account content is a lengthy process and will require you to obtain a court order it says in its guidance Google s system will only work if set up by the user Otherwise family members who want to get access to email video or other Google accounts will still have to provide a court order due to data protection laws Google s system will first send a warning text message to a mobile registered with the account and a message to a backup email account nominated by the main account owner If the user then checks in the account is deemed active again and no action is taken Among the choices Google offers are having your data deleted after three six nine or 12 months of inactivity or to have data from various of the Google services you use sent to trusted contacts Among the services survivors could receive are all the pages where you clicked the 1 buttons any blogposts and comments

metal anchored in a rounded wooden handle To grasp it is to discover how to use it And it is elegant in pursuit of that singular purpose And yet and yet for some that simplicity is a spur A goad to explore just what the corkscrew would be if it were first conceived in an age that venerated machines or their makers For mechanical sculptor Rob Higgs similar thoughts started a journey that ended at the other end of the spectrum from the simple streamlined object we all have lurking in our kitchen drawers Mr Higgs corkscrew is not slim it cannot be held in the hand and the only similarity it shares with its namesake is that it does remove corks from bottles It weighs more than three quarters of a tonne is a convoluted hedge of 382 moving parts including gears pulleys levers springs and probably flanges that is 1 6m 5ft 3in tall at its highest point is cast from brass and is a glorious sight to behold when set in ponderous whirring clanking motion Not bad for someone who he claims became a mechanical sculptor pretty much by accident I ve no formal training he told the BBC Mr Higgs is now settled in Newquay Cornwall living in a 1930s boat that he rebuilt himself Making those living quarters was his first big project but he admits his dad s family were engineers and his youth was spent in and around people who liked to create hack and tinker and were good at it Going outside the comfort zone on each job teaches me a specialist skill Mr Higgs had no desire to follow the formal route to being an engineer because it would mean he ended up in an office sitting at a computer and he would never get his hands on the finished thing And things are what he loves Living in Cornwall and putting his houseboat to rights led Mr Higgs to discover and get to know others who did similar work That contact got him tinkering and continuing to create once the houseboat was done Now the boat is his home and the yard his studio filled with all the bits bobs iron brass bric a brac and spare parts that he uses in his work Other people said there was quite a lot of work doing it though I was just making stuff for a laugh he said They said I could sell it through the Eden Project and because there was a route it became my career The rise and rise of steampunk the retro futuristic style and its love for copper brass gears and automata has helped his prospects as have movies such as Hugo The result is that for the last few years he has not had to sell his creations in shops at tourist attractions but has instead worked almost entirely to commission He has produced props for theatre productions and films or sculptures for display in museums visitor centres and other buildings His latest work in progress is a submarine complete with half tonne propeller that will take centre stage in a children s playground He treats every creation as a challenge daring himself to go far beyond any simple assumption about how a device such as a corkscrew or nutcracker is expected to work It s the unknown element and excitement of it he said going outside the comfort zone on each job teaches me a specialist skill He s as rigorous as any formal engineer in that he draws up designs for each work but he said the finished device can look very different to the initial conception He also makes each one out of scrap and junk many of which are parts or pieces of other junked mechanical objects That s important he said because it makes something of what is discarded Often key components are tools that are no longer used as tools but Mr Higgs can find a way to put them to use again Also he thinks his creations have become more valued and valuable as society has less and less to do with the mundanely mechanical Just think of the last time you had to wind a handle to get something done As the skills become less and less of something that you can see everyday it becomes a speciality he said And he s in no doubt that he is a bit special I feel like I m lucky every day he said I have to pinch myself that I can get paid regularly to do this", "The influential head of Google Eric Schmidt has called for civilian drone technology to be regulated warning

for online bingo But who is playing and why A typical evening sees Anita Heffernan 50 spending two or three hours playing bingo online It s not for the money her biggest ever win was about 400 and being a game of chance players typically spend more than they win It is a hobby says Heffernan I would much rather do that than spend a night out in town There s been a rapid growth of bingo websites As recently as 2004 fewer than 20 such sites operated in the UK now there are thought to be about 350 Operators include everyone from bingo hall owners Mecca and Gala to newspapers like The Sun and Daily Mail For a game strongly associated with the camaraderie of a night spent at crowded tables with friends any move online could be seen as being at odds with the very reasons for playing Many of the vast concrete and neon bingo halls on High Streets across the country may now be showing their age but millions still visit them every year For the uninitiated bingo is a game of pure chance There s no skill involved other than the ability to keep up in the UK version of the game players listen intently for the random numbers between one and 90 printed on their card to be called out One by one they are crossed off until someone has none left and there s a winner then they might shout bingo or house The figure at the centre of the action the caller traditionally announces each number in a language so familiar it has become corny Two fat ladies 88 clickety click 66 Advertised and played against a backdrop typically drawn in purples and pinks it is not difficult to work out who the marketing for the online version is aimed at says the University of Glasgow s Prof Gerda Reith an expert in gambling and addiction Examples include the suave purple suited fox who leads a bus full of women on a big day out in Foxy Bingo s television adverts They re trying to appeal to people they know like bingo and get them to play online That s women There are younger players Anni Nevison 21 plays two or three times a week including five hours on a Sunday I get excitement and friendship says Nevison who has been playing since she was 18 You go into a bingo site and it s like a little family it s so chatty she says of the other players she messages in the sites chatrooms She would love to meet the people she talks to although that is difficult as they are spread across the UK It is this chatroom type element which is key to the appeal of online bingo for many players Talking is frowned upon in traditional halls while the game is being played the social element happens between and after games lest players be distracted as the numbers are called But online users can talk as much as they like Many sites fill players bingo cards in automatically so that they can concentrate on chatting Online bingo terms have appeared as a result including BLNG better luck next game and HABO have a better one Should they wish to some sites also allow players to message one another privately Traditional bingo s turnover slipped 3 in the year to March 2012 according to Gambling Commission figures with main stage mechanized and seaside style prize bingo turning over 1 22bn Just 4 of people who contacted the problem gambling helpline GamCare said they played bingo Nearly one in five of its female clients were bingo players with some 70 playing online Only 24 went to traditional bingo halls The Bingo Association says there are about 400 halls in the UK half the number in the game s heyday The cost of a bingo card can be as little as 1p although most are about 10p and can be more Prizes can run into several thousand pounds although winnings usually depend on how many other people are playing and are often just a few pounds Few would see themselves as being involved in an activity comparable to poker or playing slot machines but the growth of online bingo is part of the feminisation of gambling says Mark Griffiths professor of gambling studies at Nottingham Trent University The focus on its social aspects makes it more appealing he says People conceptualise it as a bit of harmless fun a harmless flutter and even though they know its a form of gambling they never use the word says Griffiths It might be expected that the growth of online bingo would have seen linked reports of problem gambling but support organisations GamCare and the National Problem Gambling Clinic are yet to encounter it as a significant issue However Liz Karter author of Women and Problem Gambling has seen a significant rise in the number of women with an online gambling problem including bingo The things that they report as being particularly difficult are the constant advertisements it makes recovery very difficult she says The rapid growth of the sites came after the 2005 Gambling Act which swept aside strict regulation and allowed advertising for the first time says Reith Not only could women be actively encouraged to have a flutter but there was also a chance to make up for falling numbers in bingo halls The traditional game is not a money maker bingo is low stakes low turnover and it s got worse since the 2007 smoking ban says Reith Before the ban players could light up inside during games and would have no need to go outside during breaks making the bar and nearby slot machines busier Online bingo provides a chance to make up for some of that lost income The Gambling Commission s 2010 British Gambling Prevalence Survey suggests that 12 of women compared to 6 of men play bingo Among the big brands Mecca Bingo reports that a fifth of the money it now takes is online rather than in bingo halls The shift online is likely to continue says Griffiths who believes bingo is at the centre of a new type of soft gambling Heffernan wagers 20 a night and likes concentrating on the numbers watching the game play out when you get close it s quite exciting I do enjoy it she says of visits to real world bingo halls But it is slow in comparison It is not something her family understands but nor does she expect them to Bird watching No thanks Some people could spend hours looking at car magazines or whatever This is just what I do", "By

apps digital money has a reputation problem Instinctively we worry that it s too insubstantial and spending it is too frictionless But like it or not virtual economies will play a significant role in our future The global market for virtual goods such as upgrades to video games or special items within them will pass 20bn in 2015 according to analysts SuperData A single 2007 bank crash in the online multiplayer video game Second Life cost 750 000 in real life As a result a group of economists are now hunched over their computers intently studying the exchange of hats Or sofas Or as we shall see daggers made out of hamburgers As virtual economies have begun to intersect with real ones in more powerful ways observing them has changed from an amusing academic pastime to a serious attempt at modelling complex systems Take one example Noticing how much players of the online only multiplayer shooting game Team Fortress 2 seemed to enjoy dressing up their avatars its maker introduced a fetching range of hats They didn t do anything beyond giving the player a certain debonair swagger as she unloaded a hail of bullets into an opponent But people loved them nonetheless and spent real money in the hope of unlocking an unusual hat that rained confetti or was bathed in green smoke Very quickly the hats became a currency For economists virtual economies provide an avalanche of data unlike anything they ve been able to analyse before At Princeton doctoral candidate Juha Tolvanen is studying how players insure their spaceships in the game Eve Online In June 2012 observers were able to track the crash in Diablo III s online market in hamburgers that also functioned as daggers when players discovered they weren t any good for stabbing people with Video game companies are coming round to the idea that their virtual economies can provide real world insights Valve which is behind Team Fortress 2 hired the eurozone crisis expert Yanis Varoufakis as its in house economist last year When I ask him why on earth hats should have become so valuable he reminds me that currency selection is based on some necessary features liquidity intrinsic value aesthetics relative price but also some intangibles Why cigarettes in prison or particular baseball cards among teenagers in the 1960s or salt in medieval Asia Finnish researcher Vili Lehdonvirta author of the forthcoming book Virtual Economies agrees that game currencies show us just how arbitrary our estimations of value are He points to Habbo a social networking game People developed their own currency because the system didn t have an official one So people would trade green sofas and use that as a measure of value Sometimes what s being traded can seem seriously weird to the outsider Lehdonvirta says that in the 1990s text games run by Iron Realms instead of a picture of a sword you d have a description of a sword and sell those for money But if enough people decide that a description of a sword has a value then it does Perhaps the biggest lesson from video game economies is that human beings seem to like markets Daniel James who created the online game Puzzle Pirates says he was taken aback that players wanted to spend their time running virtual shops when they could be buccaneering swashbuckling or generally shivering their timbers He was surprised how aspirational it is for players to be in business and how much work they put in Lehdonvirta sees virtual economies as a rebuke to the early internet philosophers who thought they were creating a world of abundance where objects could be replicated without cost Now we ve discovered this idea called artificial scarcity and discovered that some people prefer that to abundance he says We want to use objects for social signification to set apart the haves from the have nots According to that logic owning a hamburger dagger or a hat wreathed in smoke is no stupider than coveting a pair of shoes you can t walk in or a watch that costs dozens of times the value of the materials used to make it Maybe the new virtual economies aren t quite as new or as weird as they first seem", "Google will allow users to decide what happens to their

smartphones meant we would all soon be sharing our location online and being targeted with offers from local businesses The leader of a wave of start ups founded on this prediction was Foursquare a New York based app and social network that allows users to check in to locations and so alert friends nearby they are around for coffee lunch and so on Each check in would also earn the member points gain the most points at a particular location and Foursquare would appoint you Mayor with a digital badge to proudly display online It was a huge hit with the neophiliac crowd at South by Southwest Interactive an annual web industry conference in Austin Texas After providing a launch pad for Twitter in 2007 the excitement around Foursquare at 2009 s event meant it was tipped for great success Fast forward a couple of years and the signs are less encouraging for Foursquare and location based services in general Foursquare has received more than 70m in venture capital funding some of it valuing the firm at 600m In November it was reported to be offering investors more equity at a valuation of up to 800m despite annual revenues of just 2m Twitter to introduce music app What type of social media user are you Social addicts suffer withdrawal Facebook backed campaign group to push for more open US immigration Music and social media where fans meet artists Perhaps unsurprisingly nobody bit This week Foursquare said it had raised a further 41m but most of it in the form of a multi year loan and some in debt that could be converted to shares later Dennis Crowley the 36 year old founder and chief executive of the company seemingly admits Foursquare has a credibility problem This allows us to get closer to being able to prove that there s a real business here he said as the latest cash injection was announced He doesn t sound particularly convinced despite having proselytised location based services for over a decade The plan is to change the perception of Foursquare from that of a kind of game where the aim is to gain points and badges to that of location based reviews service It is now pitched as an easy way to find recommendations for local restaurants bars or shops With that in mind this week it released a redesigned version of its iPhone app that brings its search function to the fore allowing users to more easily browse the reviews Foursquare aims to sell more targeted advertising against the glut of local searches it hopes the new app will generate It seems a relatively sensible idea but there are major problems First whereas Foursquare as game was more or less unique providing local reviews and recommendations is a crowded field The market is dominated by big profitable companies such as Yelp in the United States Tripadvisor for tourists and Google which has made a series of acquisitions to bolster its database of reviews The second problem is a basic lack of scale Despite a relatively high profile four years online Foursquare claims only 30 million members How many are actually active on the service is another matter of course but as a social network compared to Twitter or Facebook it has completely failed to capture mainstream attention It will need its members to do a lot of searching to justify the 110m that has been ploughed into the business Mr Crowley insists slow growth is a deliberate smart strategy We ve looked at the way other companies have grown very very aggressively with products that seem to be working but are not the ones that end up changing the landscape he said Facing apathy and more powerful rivals some analysts have predicted Foursquare s ultimate failure nevertheless It already stands as a lesson that the tech crowd do not necessarily know what ordinary people want to do online Even Facebook with its hundreds of millions of active members to guide it introduced a check in feature that owed a large debt to Foursquare in 2010 It was scrapped a year later due to lack of interest", "This is a story of theft loss discovery and of mortification designed for the digital age It tells how a laptop stolen in London found its way to a family in Tehran and how via a hidden app the rightful owner

company in London s Shoreditch In February his computer was stolen in a burglary at his home in Holloway Road north London A month later a tracking app he had installed in the laptop revealed not only that his computer was in Tehran but was transmitting pictures back of the family using it Intrigued Del Torto set up a Tumblr page Dom s Laptop in Iran showing his computer s new owners interactions

home in February 2013 he said on his blog this week In March 2013 tracking software revealed that it had turned up in Tehran Iran I shared this information with the UK police dealing with the matter and they said that they were regretfully unable to help On 12 April 2013 I decided to share the data from the laptop on a Tumblr blog as an amusing story for my friends to enjoy It seemed to me that a laptop that went missing from London and turned up in Iran was like a space probe landing on a distant planet and beaming back proof of intelligent life The story began to go viral As the story circulated I started to receive messages from concerned individuals warning of privacy issues and the possible harm and distress the blog may cause the people in the photos I hadn t really considered any of this as I hadn t expected the story to get so much attention So I hid the identity of the people in the photos Then one of the people in the photos contacted him to ask him to remove the pictures They were very upset I could understand why The people shown on the blog site are not thieves The safety and wellbeing of private individuals is more important than any possession Although I still miss my laptop I do not wish ill on anyone The people who now have my laptop have been good enough to get in touch and therefore the tracking software has done its job There are questions that remain unanswered Del Torto who feels he made a huge error of judgment posting pictures of the family undisguised was not returning calls And how his computer made its way to Iran and into the hands

game based on The Simpsons television series Cavendish Elithorn OFT senior director for goods and consumer said We are concerned that children and their parents could be subject to unfair pressure to purchase when they are playing games they thought were free but which can actually run up substantial costs The OFT is not seeking to ban in game purchases but the games industry must ensure it is complying with the relevant regulations so that children are protected We are speaking to the industry and will take enforcement action if necessary According to officials the OFT will investigate how companies providing free web or app based games market their products to children Parents and consumer groups will be asked to contact the watchdog with information about potentially misleading or commercially aggressive practices in relation to these games The OFT action will look into whether games include direct exhortations to children a strong encouragement to make a purchase which would be illegal under consumer protection legislation A breach carries a maximum 5 000 fine or two years prison It will also investigate whether children were made aware of the full cost of these games when they were initially downloaded The OFT expects to publish its next steps by October 2013", "By Rosie Murray West 7 00AM BST 12 Apr 2013 Comments The decision comes after several high profile cases where children have racked up large bills buying virtual currency gems or fruit in games that their parents thought were free Martin Lewis from Moneysavingexpert said that something is going wrong in the system when games such as My Little Pony which are obviously targeted at young children bait kids with 69 purchases of a mountain of gems The OFT is demanding information from the companies concerned but parents who allow their children to play on such games will need more immediate protection Follow the pointers below to ensure your children don t rack up bills online Protect your password Letting youngsters sit on your knee while you use your smartphone or tablet means they re likely to know your password and that can be expensive Make sure you change your passwords

Streetmap Google has submitted an offer to the EU that will soon be shown to rivals and customers as part of settlement talks to end the probe into claims its search results damage competitors EU

why there are so many animals on the social news website he often illustrates his answer with a reference to Ridley Scott s seminal sci fi movie Blade Runner When people complain to me about too many animals on Buzzfeed I always ask them whether they re a serial killer and sociopath or whether they re android he says only half joking Peretti is referring to the Voight Kampff test in the 31 year old film where investigators attempt to distinguish between androids or replicants and humans by their response to a series of animal related questions Would you rescue a tortoise baking in the hot desert sun Someone gives you a calfskin wallet How do you respond His point is that it is human nature to respond warmly and positively to animals providing a possible explanation for the popularity of trademark Buzzfeed posts such as 60 Basset Hounds In Costumes and 31 Cats Who Have Seen Things You Wouldn t Believe A combination of viral ready hits breaking news and spin off memes has cemented Buzzfeed s rise as perhaps the world s fastest growing news website Since its launch in 2006 the New York based site has grown to 40 million visitors a month and recently opened its first international office in London Buzzfeed has taken 46m in venture capital investment in five years valuing it at 200m or five times its expected sales revenue this year It employs 215 writers editors and algorithm wizards in New York Los Angeles and London It places as much emphasis on spreading the word as on the message itself In a similar way to YouTube and HuffPo the site has a network of contributors supplying free user generated content to which its in house staff give a final polish Contributors are awarded badges LOL Trashy Fail if their article inspires a certain number of responses The most popular contributors sometimes land a paid job following an induction process that includes receiving email elerts whenever a post begins to go viral The aim is that writers and editors will know how to create viral content before readers know they want to read it Buzzfeed is the brainchild of Peretti a rail thin Californian who is a combination of programmer journalist and marketer His love affair with viral content began in 2001 as a graduate student in the Media Lab at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT Instead of writing his master s thesis Peretti decided to play the smartass and asked Nike to emblazon the word sweatshop on a customised pair of trainers Unsurprisingly it objected but his terse email exchange with a Nike official was quickly spread among thousands of bored office workers Eventually Peretti debated the issue of sweatshop labour with a Nike spokeswoman on NBC s The Today Show That 15 minutes of fame gave him the bug Peretti and his younger sister Chelsea a standup comedian and writer set up the New York Rejection Line a service for those pestered by people who refused to leave them alone it supplied you with your phone number to give them which played an automated brush off message when they rang it The pair s next stunt also ended up on national TV BlackPeopleLoveUs was the online home of a fictional white couple Sally and Johnny who were desperate to befriend African Americans It went viral and its creators were interviewed on ABC s Good Morning America Peretti was also part of the internet power quartet who founded the Huffington Post in early 2005 remaining at the helm of the news site and blog until its 315m sale to AOL in February 2011 After six years at HuffPo 39 year old Peretti said the acquisition represented a natural breaking point for him to leave and concentrate on Buzzfeed Now the two sites are in competition but there is no indication that Peretti plans to follow Arianna Huffington s example by selling out A lot of web companies will take a short term approach and sell to an incumbent and don t end up living up to their full potential he says If we can entertain and inform people and generate great return for advertisers we can have a much bigger longer path We re not like something that came before us we re qualitatively different Described by a former colleague as extremely pragmatic and shrewd rather than idealistic and hopeful Peretti has an eye for the future that has drawn a number of senior media executives to beat a path to his door He met Rupert Murdoch and other top News Corporation executives at the CES gadget show in Las Vegas in January The media tycoon described Peretti s Buzzfeed pitch as the most fun he d seen and Peretti is quick to return the compliment He was shockingly attentive and engaged at understanding things at a really high level he says It is anyone s guess what Murdoch makes of a site that reacted to Lady Thatcher s death last week with an avalanche of stories a mixture of serious and silly such as Margaret Thatcher s 19 Most Badass Moments and 16 Cats Interpret 16 Margaret Thatcher Quotes Buzzfeed s New York headquarters are only a two minute walk from Madison Avenue but it is a world away from the Mad Men era of advertising The site carries no display ads shunning the intrusive banners that online readers have learned to ignore and instead experimenting with sponsored editorial Brands such as Coca Cola Nike and Virgin Mobile regularly appear as featured partners on wacky lists that do not look out of place on the site s homepage There was a long period where newspapers were the only way an advertiser could get its message to the public They were essentially monopolies he says Now brands can go direct to the public If you look at the heritage of the best advertising you can make stuff that is great for both readers and advertisers I don t think Don Draper would have loved banner ads So where is the rest of the media going wrong The biggest misconception people have is that quality is all that matters Peretti says in an admission likely to give further ammunition to those who think the site is trashy and downmarket The truth is that quality helps but there s a ton of high quality things that don t go anywhere In his keynote talk at MediaGuardian s Changing Media Summit in London last month Peretti used a striking analogy with Judaism and Mormonism to demonstrate this point There was one Mormon for every 10 Jews in 1950 according to Peretti and now there are fewer Jews than believers in the religion whose best known adherent is the Killers frontman Brandon Flowers Mormons know that it s not enough to practise your religion you also have to spread your religion Age 39

based software allows users to add details about buildings hiking trails vegetation and other features to its maps of the country Suggested additions and amendments are reviewed by other users and the firm s own staff before going live The move comes at a time when Apple Nokia and others are investing heavily in rival free to use mapping technologies Experts suggest the rise of GPS enabled devices means the efforts could hold the key to future profits if the firms add location triggered adverts or use the data to promote situation specific services But for now they see little or no financial return from their current smartphone map apps beyond the value added to their brands Google first launched its Map Maker service in 2008 to allow users to help it add details to its maps of Pakistan Vietnam and just over a dozen other countries It allowed the firm to fill in blanks to the third party data it had licensed at a time when its own cartographers were focused on other territories The company later extended the facility to much of the rest of the world including the US France and Australia countries where it also uses sensor equipped cars to collect mapping data Google said there were technical obstacles to overcome when merging any of its existing data with Map Maker helping explain why it had taken until now to bring it to the UK Ahead of the launch workers at Bletchley Park the site of Britain s World War II codebreaking efforts trialled the software to help promote the roll out The search giant had previously donated money towards the estate s restoration fund Map Maker users are presented with an interface allowing them to add four types of content Click through menus allow specific details about each feature and relevant internet links to be added There is also an option to edit pre existing objects Users wishing to amend the firm s UK maps had previously only been able to report problems or suggest limited changes Before alterations are made to Google s live maps other contributors must review the suggestions To encourage this Google lets users click a button to show proposed alterations in their neighbourhood and Map Maker Pulse a constantly updating display of submissions made across the UK each one shown seconds after it is uploaded Volunteers build up a confidence score as more of their submissions are approved and after a while require fewer checks We have a trust moderation system in place and that algorithmically figures out whether we can trust this person and how sensitive the feature is project manager Jessica Pfund told the BBC No matter how trusted you are if you change a very prominent feature like a Tate art gallery it s going to have to go through a lot more moderation than if you add a small restaurant to the rural countryside She added that users could expect accurate additions to go live within a few days of them being proposed Ms Pfund acknowledged that in its current state Map Maker did not work well on mobile devices recommending it only be used on PCs Users may also wish to bear in mind the firm s terms and conditions which state You give Google a perpetual irrevocable worldwide royalty free and non exclusive licence to reproduce adapt modify translate publish publicly perform publicly display distribute and create derivative works of the user submission One contributor to OpenStreetMap a separate crowdsourced effort to map the world suggested Google s terms might make its maps unsuitable for some The biggest problem with Google Map Maker is that anything people contribute may appear on Google s map but only Google can get at the underlying data to be able to do anything else with it said Chris Hill If someone includes a Google map on their web site to show where their business is they may also be showing where their competitors are and they can t change that Others too are trying to outsource at least part of their cartographic efforts to volunteers Apple s chief executive Tim Cook said his firm appreciated feedback when he apologised in September for the rocky start to the iPhone maker s own app promising the more our customers use our Maps the better it will get Nokia is

caused by pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria viruses parasites or fungi the diseases can be spread directly or indirectly from one person to another Quite so Just like Facebook addiction which also spreads from person to person and has now reached pandemic proportions with more than a billion sufferers worldwide The Facebook pathogen doesn t kill people of course for the good reason that dead people don t buy stuff But it does seem to affect victims brains For example it reduces normally articulate and sophisticated people to gibbering in the online equivalent of grunts Likewise it obliges them to coalesce all the varieties of human relationships into a simply binary pair friends v everyone else I have some real friends as opposed to friends on Facebook and every so often one of them posts a comment on something I ve written I ve just looked at one such observation It s thoughtful subtle and nicely written But beneath it is a button simply labelled Like If I click on it my friend will doubtless receive a message from Facebook telling him that I like his comment Big deal What s interesting about this is the way a software system has been designed to strip all of the nuances and complexities that characterise human interaction and compress them into a channel with the bandwidth of Morse code Actually the bandwidth is even more attenuated than that At least with Morse something can be either a dot or a dash but Facebook lacks even that binary sophistication It only has a Like button possibly because a Dislike one might facilitate a higher level of discourse than that deemed desirable by the system s architect Cultural critic Neil Postman once observed that you can t use smoke signals for philosophical discussions the communication channel simply doesn t have the necessary bandwidth One wonders what he would have made of Facebook or of the fact that a sixth of the world s population is apparently satisfied by such a primitive medium of communication Meanwhile the efforts of Facebook s owners to monetise these poor saps continue unabated The basic idea is to use their personal data to refine the targeting of ads at them which means that as time goes on the system becomes more and more tiresome to use This raises the spectre that one day the worms might turn and depart But hey Facebook management has a plan for that too It s revealed in a fascinating patent application just published Like all patent applications it consists of three coats of prime technical verbiage and the devil is in the detail but the essence of it is that in exchange for a monthly payment Facebook users will be able to get rid of ads and specify exactly what should replace them on their personal profiles This is subtly different from what other freemium services like Spotify currently offer You have to admire the chutzpah implicit in this First you bombard your hapless users with ads Then you offer them relief in return for payment There s a word for this in English but m learned friends don t approve of it so I will avoid it I ll be surprised if the patent is approved but the US Patent and Trademark Office has a track record in granting daft patents as for example US Patent 5 443 036 for a method of exercising a cat by getting it to follow a spot generated by a laser pointer so I might be unduly optimistic For fiendish ingenuity however Facebook s latest move into the mobile phone business takes the biscuit Neatly avoiding the trap of getting into the handset manufacturing game the company has instead developed an Android app that really ought to be codenamed Cuckoo because it effectively takes over any handset on which it is installed It can be downloaded for a subset of recent Android handsets and last week HTC unveiled the first phone that comes with Facebook Home pre installed The app conceals the array of apps that normally dominate Android home screens and instead puts Facebook activity squarely in the centre of the phone s screen It splashes status updates across the phone s lock and home screens and makes Facebook s messenger application ubiquitous with little Chat Heads that follow you from app to app thereby making it easy to keep up with what pass for conversations on Facebook What Facebook Home means of course is that Facebook will be the first and perhaps the only thing that new users of smartphones especially in emerging markets ie poor countries see when they fire up their phones And when they want to search for something why they will use Facebook s search engine rather than that of Google the company that created the operating system on which Facebook s app runs Howzat", "By Andrew Griffiths 7 00AM BST 13 Apr 2013 Because of my hips and knees all my spring has gone Once I am on the floor I can t get up at all I can t raise myself So I have to have my panic button They come and unroll this big square thing and push it under my seat switch on the machine and it very gently lifts me Once I m up I can stand but I can t get up from ground level at all I just have to have help and they have been wonderful for me I am sitting with Edith Garside in her neat Peak District bungalow The room is colourful and warm particularly so in contrast to the cold day outside Mrs Garside is 90 years old and untouched by any mental deterioration As we wait for one of her regular wardens to arrive she is telling me about the care service which she often uses The button hangs around her neck like a piece of functional jewellery and in the case of a fall or any other emergency it can alert a warden within minutes In itself it is not a complicated piece of equipment and has been around for some time but it marked the beginning of the use of technology to prolong independent living In recent years there has been an explosion in technological innovation in the field of elderly care Mrs Garside and her warden are in their different ways at the coalface of the looming crisis of how we are going to care for the elderly in our ageing society We are facing a future where a shrinking workforce is going to have to support a growing population of older people The number of over 65s in Britain stood at 15 per cent in 1985 By 2010 this had risen to 17 per cent an increase of 1 7 million It is projected that by 2035 those over 65 will make up 23 per cent of the population A cursory glance at numbers like these explains why the race is on to find technological solutions to elderly care motivated by a need both to improve services and to save costs Much of the technology in development can be broadly broken down into two camps One is monitoring and surveillance whereby electronic devices keep track of a person s medical condition and automatically alert health care staff when intervention is required Sensors can also be fitted into the home that will alert staff if for example someone is not in bed when they should be a sign that something may have gone wrong The other main area of active research is assistive technologies which can range from a simple device to help an arthritic hand turn on a tap to a robotic machine that is able to spoon feed an older person without the need for health care staff attention Care for elderly at home Thousands of dementia sufferers rarely see loved ones Number of over 90s has tripled in 30 years Dementia timebomb will hit 1 2m Much of this technology is designed to be fitted into the home to allow independent living for as long as possible According to Prof James Goodwin the head of research for Age UK We are not far from the day when people routinely have their health monitored from home On the face of it prolonging independent living is a laudable aim but some argue that it has the potential for abuse Health care provision is a delicate balancing act between service levels and cost and while many of these technologies can be used to improve the quality of older people s lives it can also be much cheaper to keep people in their homes rather than occupying hospital beds Like the criticism once levelled at care in the community some are concerned that it may be the right policy for the wrong reasons Dr Christine Brown Wilson the programme director at the University of Manchester s School of Nursing Midwifery and Social Work has an optimistic view of how these new technologies will be applied She sees a future where technology will be used to perform the routine tasks leaving staff more quality time to spend with those in their care I think we have to realise that we are in charge of the technology Brown Wilson who has a background in practical nursing says The technology doesn t have to guide us we have to guide the technology Others though such as Prof Noel Sharkey an expert in the field of robotics at the University of Sheffield warn of the potential for a future where cutting corners and costs leads to the elderly becoming little more than prisoners in their own homes socially isolated and tended to largely by machines People will say Oh that s science fiction Sharkey says but it is not He estimates that the technology will be there to allow such fiction to become a reality within a decade Where there are problems there are opportunities and developing technologies that will help in the care of the elderly is becoming big business The University of Manchester actively encourages an interdisciplinary approach to research into ageing For example one collaboration between the university s schools of nursing and engineering has produced a proto type of a pressure sensitive carpet underlay that can measure people s gait The concept of the carpet if not the technology that lies behind it is simple A fibre optic mid layer detects the pressure of each footstep and sends data to a computer where they can be analysed Falls can obviously be detected but it is more subtle than that It can pick up changes in a person s gait over time and so act as a predictor of a likelihood of falling allowing a health care professional to be alerted if required The hope is that a fall and a potentially expensive hospital stay can be averted Given that between 30 and 40 per cent of community dwelling old people fall each year and that falls in the home account for 50 per cent of hospital admissions in the over 65 age group there is scope for such technology to save the NHS a great deal of money Brown Wilson whose research interest is early illness detection in the elderly and dementia sufferers worked on the underlay project I started out by asking What can we do with this technology she explains From this collaboratively they defined an application The engineers are interested in coming up with novel technology I m interested in actually dealing with health care issues The collaborative process was not without its difficulties Dr Patricia Scully a senior scientist at the School of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Science at the University of Manchester says Initially there was a mismatch there They want a technology that is easy to use so they can get their statistics right and we want a technology that is of social benefit But as engineers we might want to sell it and make money for a company That interface between us was quite difficult to bridge But they bridged it sufficiently well to produce a working prototype currently residing in the corner of the university s photo optics laboratory in the Photon Science Institute Bench scientist Dr John Vaughan 62 appropriately enough came out of retirement to build the mat He shows me a sample of the carpet with the backing pulled away in between which the fibre optics are inserted The carpet was an offcut from a local shop and for a moment his face lights up with the childlike delight all scientists seem to show when they have managed to incorporate a complex design into an everyday object It is a reminder of the fundamental creativity that is at the heart of science The team see applications in care homes and the smart carpet could be easily fitted into an older person s own home to assist in independent living They are now looking for a commercial partner with which to develop the project and have a number of companies showing interest Some might consider these technologies to be intrusive But Brown Wilson is keen to draw a distinction between monitoring for preventative purposes and surveillance The early illness detection that we are proposing is actually only alerting somebody if something out of the ordinary happens she tells me The health care professional is only alerted when something goes wrong but before something goes catastrophically wrong Monitoring technologies are always operating and collecting data If somebody goes out of a door we know that they have gone out of the door she says But we are not watching you all the time Telehealth and telecare technologies are seen as key to enabling independent living for older people The terms cover a multitude of applications from sensors placed in the home that can transmit information about whether the person is in bed sitting in a chair or indeed on the floor having fallen to the monitoring of blood pressure and blood sugar levels The information is gathered in the home prior to analysis at a central data centre allowing health care staff to be alerted as appropriate Goodwin sees three main issues associated with telehealth are the readings valid and reliable Will older people accept the intrusion and loss of control that such devices may confer And from a health provider s point of view will the provision of such care lead to real savings for the NHS A piece of technology that has recently caught his eye came out of the award panel of the Royal College of Art on which he sits It is a small Gore Tex patch that is placed on the upper arm along with a subdermal probe that monitors blood sugar levels There is also a chip which transmits data back to a mobile phone and displays a warning on a traffic light system of red amber or green This solves one of the main problems of diabetes control Goodwin says which is compliance or adherence Usually people have to actively remember to test their own blood sugar levels which can easily be forgotten particularly by the elderly Self monitoring is not as reliable as you might think In December 2011 the Government published the results of the largest trial in the world for telecare and telehealth Launched in May 2008 the study involved 6 191 patients for a minimum of 12 months in east London Kent and Cornwall of these 3 030 had one of three conditions diabetes heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease The study showed that there was a reduction in hospital bed days of 14 per cent emergency admissions were down 20 per cent and mortality rates were reduced by 45 per cent The scope then for these technologies to save the NHS money is considerable Other technology in development though still very much a work in progress is pervasive computing which means that a computer is always working in the background at home A combination of sensors trackers and software analysis learns to identify a person performing simple tasks The system is being developed to assist early stage dementia sufferers who can often forget the next step when doing something as simple as making a cup of tea The computer can sense what task is being performed and provide an audible prompt for the next step Technology though no matter how clever it may be is not in itself enough It still requires the human touch According to Goodwin in too many cases there has been too much reliance on technically driven solutions and not enough on collaboratively developed products I come across multiple examples where products are developed then they ask users if they are acceptable rather than having older people involved right from the start so that the conversation irons out some of the problems before they get there Goodwin chaired last year s Royal College of Engineering RCE conference which considered the role of technology in providing cost effective care for the elderly Keeping people out of hospitals and helping them live safely and comfortably in their own homes for as long as possible are challenges where engineers see themselves as having a crucial role There was much talk and excitement about developments in the field of robotics Goodwin considers the RCE conference to have been a good and constructive day but this hasn t always been his experience when dealing with scientists and technologists who are developing products for the elderly For them the technology is everything and you really have to fight your corner to get them to acknowledge that there is an ethical issue then discuss it Goodwin explains It s the last thing they want to hear For many the human face of robotics is Prof Sharkey of the University of Sheffield He was a judge on the television show Robot Wars which aired from 1998 to 2004 and became that strange hybrid creature the celebrity academic Now there is something of the poacher turned gamekeeper about Sharkey He has gone from gleefully presiding over robotic machines bashing seven bells out of each other to leaving the laboratory behind and concentrating his research purely on Human Robot Interaction and ethical issues arising from the way that society is likely to employ this technology When people talk about robots we often think of upright metallic humanoid creatures strutting about the place but as Sharkey explains most robotic applications in health care will look much more like machines He outlines some that are available now and in use in Japan a country farther down the road when it comes to meeting the challenges of an ageing population There is a robot that can wash people s hair for example It sprays water shampoo and conditioner on to the head then 24 robotic fingers knead the scalp It is claimed to be a more relaxing experience than a wash from another human Another machine sits on an elderly patient s lap like a tray while a robotic arm clutching a spoon feeds the patient unattended by health care staff Others are designed to act as companions to dementia sufferers and combat the loneliness that so often afflicts the elderly Paro is a small robotic seal that is in use in Japan and responds to the human voice and to movement One company in America estimates that by 2020 the personal assistant robot will be as ubiquitous as the PC is today Sharkey is more aware than most that the technology can have a vital role providing that its application is person driven and empowers the older patient in their goal of independent living The worst scenario is that people are just left in the hands of machines he says Sharkey is keen for us to be aware of the ethical issues involved in robotics care He cites the example of a dementia sufferer living in a house with a door leading out on to a busy road Should the robot be empowered to prevent the person from walking out of the door If so you have to think is that machine keeping them prisoner now Sharkey asks There are always two edges to these things If it were your own mother you might well think Well yes I don t want her walking out on the road If people are fully monitored he adds if they fall over you can be in there in a second that sounds great But if you set up an alerting system so that if anything happens at all you can get medics in there very quickly there is no reason for seeing them the rest of the time What I am worried about losing is the element of care Sharkey thinks that Britain and Europe in general have the advantage in that we will see the introduction of robotic care happen elsewhere first Japan the USA and China are a long way ahead when it comes to developing and implementing these kinds of technology Goodwin is also concerned that these technologies designed to prolong independent living may actually end up increasing the level of isolation experienced by older people The paradox about living in your own home and being in a care home is that in the care home you are not in the environment that you want but you are surrounded by people In your own home you re in the environment that you want but you have no social contact or less social contact But for Mrs Garside there can be no replacing her human carers and no replacing her own home Sharkey thinks some older people would prefer to have a machine to conduct some tasks personal care for instance as they would be embarrassed to have another human do it for them I suppose there must be some people who think like that Mrs Garside says tactfully But I am not one of them I love humanity and I am glad to be a part of it As she leads me from the warmth of her bungalow she tells me that she is sorry she could not be more enthusiastic about my robots I ask her to sum up how she would feel about being constantly monitored in the way that some of the technologies I have been describing to her would propose to do I would hate it she says emphatically But Mrs Garside is 90 As Sharkey points out it is not really today s elderly we should be asking about technology but those of us who have grown up surrounded by computers and smart phones to whom gadgets are an everyday part of our lives If Sharkey s dystopian vision should ever come to pass then a caricature of human compassion etched on to the face of a robot carer may be for some of us the last act of kindness we ever see", "By Matthew

overabundance of food obesity diabetes and have started to change our diets But most of us do not yet understand that news is to the mind what sugar is to the body News is easy to digest The media feeds us small bites of trivial matter tidbits that don t really concern our lives and don t require thinking That s why we experience almost no saturation Unlike reading books and long magazine articles which require thinking we can swallow limitless quantities of news flashes which are bright coloured candies for the mind Today we have reached the same point in relation to information that we faced 20 years ago in regard to food We are beginning to recognise how toxic news can be News misleads Take the following event borrowed from Nassim Taleb A car drives over a bridge and the bridge collapses What does the news media focus on The car The person in the car Where he came from Where he planned to go How he experienced the crash if he survived But that is all irrelevant What s relevant The structural stability of the bridge That s the underlying risk that has been lurking and could lurk in other bridges But the car is flashy it s dramatic it s a person non abstract and it s news that s cheap to produce News leads us to walk around with the completely wrong risk map in our heads So terrorism is over rated Chronic stress is under rated The collapse of Lehman Brothers is overrated Fiscal irresponsibility is under rated Astronauts are over rated Nurses are under rated We are not rational enough to be exposed to the press Watching an airplane crash on television is going to change your attitude toward that risk regardless of its real probability If you think you can compensate with the strength of your own inner contemplation you are wrong Bankers and economists who have powerful incentives to compensate for news borne hazards have shown that they cannot The only solution cut yourself off from news consumption entirely News is irrelevant Out of the approximately 10 000 news stories you have read in the last 12 months name one that because you consumed it allowed you to make a better decision about a serious matter affecting your life your career or your business The point is the consumption of news is irrelevant to you But people find it very difficult to recognise what s relevant It s much easier to recognise what s new The relevant versus the new is the fundamental battle of the current age Media organisations want you to believe that news offers you some sort of a competitive advantage Many fall for that We get anxious when we re cut off from the flow of news In reality news consumption is a competitive disadvantage The less news you consume the bigger the advantage you have News has no explanatory power News items are bubbles popping on the surface of a deeper world Will accumulating facts help you understand the world Sadly no The relationship is inverted The important stories are non stories slow powerful movements that develop below journalists radar but have a transforming effect The more news factoids you digest the less of the big picture you will understand If more information leads to higher economic success we d expect journalists to be at the top of the pyramid That s not the case News is toxic to your body It constantly triggers the limbic system Panicky stories spur the release of cascades of glucocorticoid cortisol This deregulates your immune system and inhibits the release of growth hormones In other words your body finds itself in a state of chronic stress High glucocorticoid levels cause impaired digestion lack of growth cell hair bone nervousness and susceptibility to infections The other potential side effects include fear aggression tunnel vision and desensitisation News increases cognitive errors News feeds the mother of all cognitive errors confirmation bias In the words of Warren Buffett What the human being is best at doing is interpreting all new information so that their prior conclusions remain intact News exacerbates this flaw We become prone to overconfidence take stupid risks and misjudge opportunities It also exacerbates another cognitive error the story bias Our brains crave stories that make sense even if they don t correspond to reality Any journalist who writes The market moved because of X or the company went bankrupt because of Y is an idiot I am fed up with this cheap way of explaining the world News inhibits thinking Thinking requires concentration Concentration requires uninterrupted time News pieces are specifically engineered to interrupt you They are like viruses that steal attention for their own purposes News makes us shallow thinkers But it s worse than that News severely affects memory There are two types of memory Long range memory s capacity is nearly infinite but working memory is limited to a certain amount of slippery data The path from short term to long term memory is a choke point in the brain but anything you want to understand must pass through it If this passageway is disrupted nothing gets through Because news disrupts concentration it weakens comprehension Online news has an even worse impact In a 2001 study two scholars in Canada showed that comprehension declines as the number of hyperlinks in a document increases Why Because whenever a link appears your brain has to at least make the choice not to click which in itself is distracting News is an intentional interruption system News works like a drug As stories develop we want to know how they continue With hundreds of arbitrary storylines in our heads this craving is increasingly compelling and hard to ignore Scientists used to think that the dense connections formed among the 100 billion neurons inside our skulls were largely fixed by the time we reached adulthood Today we know that this is not the case Nerve cells routinely break old connections and form new ones The more news we consume the more we exercise the neural circuits devoted to skimming and multitasking while ignoring those used for reading deeply and thinking with profound focus Most news consumers even if they used to be avid book readers have lost the ability to absorb lengthy articles or books After four five pages they get tired their concentration vanishes they become restless It s not because they got older or their schedules became more onerous It s because the physical structure of their brains has changed News wastes time If you read the newspaper for 15 minutes each morning then check the news for 15 minutes during lunch and 15 minutes before you go to bed then add five minutes here and there when you re at work then count distraction and refocusing time you will lose at least half a day every week Information is no longer a scarce commodity But attention is You are not that irresponsible with your money reputation or health Why give away your mind News makes us passive News stories are overwhelmingly about things you cannot influence The daily repetition of news about things we can t act upon makes us passive It grinds us down until we adopt a worldview that is pessimistic desensitised sarcastic and fatalistic The scientific term is learned helplessness It s a bit of a stretch but I would not be surprised if news consumption at least partially contributes to the widespread disease of depression News kills creativity Finally things we already know limit our creativity This is one reason that mathematicians novelists composers and entrepreneurs often produce their most creative works at a young age Their brains enjoy a wide uninhabited space that emboldens them to come up with and pursue novel ideas I don t know a single truly creative mind who is a news junkie not a writer not a composer mathematician physician scientist musician designer architect or painter On the other hand I know a bunch of viciously uncreative minds who consume news like drugs If you want to come up with old solutions read news If you are looking for new solutions don t Society needs journalism but in a different way Investigative journalism is always relevant We need reporting that polices our institutions and uncovers truth But important findings don t have to arrive in the form of news Long journal articles and in depth books are good too I have now gone without news for four years so I

based on the same kind of technology used in airport scanners has revealed images beneath a fresco held at the Louvre museum in Paris Trois Hommes Armes de Lances was known to be a fresco forged by Giampetro Campana on a wall from Roman times The new research suggests that under that forgery lies a real Roman fresco The discovery was announced at the American Chemical Society meeting by Bianca Jackson of the University of Rochester in the US Terahertz waves are known for their ability to penetrate materials without damaging them and have in recent years been added to the suite of tools used to examine items of cultural heritage These tools span much of the electromagnetic spectrum from X rays to ultraviolet to the infrared and of course microscopy with visible light Terahertz light which lies between infrared light like that used by remote controls and the microwaves in the appliance of the same name has become popular in scanning technology at airports and museums back rooms because it can extract information without risk of damage It s very desirable for cultural heritage conservation because with a lot of other techniques like X ray or ultraviolet there is some molecular breakdown in the materials Dr Jackson told the meeting So even though you re using the equipment to get information to conserve it you re at the same time risking some deterioration of the object Giampetro Campana was a renowned collector from the mid 19th Century who specialised in Roman artefacts But late in his career he took to restoring or outright creating Roman style works and passing them off as genuine Previous studies of Trois Hommes Armes de Lances had used X ray fluorescence which yields a list of all the atoms within an object but showed that there were atoms present in the work that were not present on the surface Dr Jackson and her colleagues were called in to apply terahertz imaging to find out what lay beneath After quite a bit of data processing we were able to pull out some signs that there is a figure beneath what looked like two eyes eyebrows nose mouth a shadow for a chin she said It remains to be proven that the image beneath is of Roman origin but the collector s history seems to suggest it The original may simply have been of poor quality If you go on Ebay and you can get a Roman coin from 200BC for 25 cents there s a reason it s not high quality Dr Jackson told BBC News So he probably painted over it because he could get more credit if he had a nice painting", "Reading this on mobile Click here to view Telling the story of a tiny hovering

syllables in laying down the law Please do not watch the show through a screen on your smart device camera it said along with some stronger words unrepeatable here During the gig vocalist Karen O repeated the request telling fans to take a picture right at that moment but to then keep devices hidden for the good of those around them On the web news of the band s defiance against the march of the amateur filmmaker spread and was met with whoops of delight from many music fans fed up with seeing mobiles thrust into their line of sight at every public event Many of them longed for the days when the only thing illuminating the crowd at a packed gig would be a sea of cigarette lighters held aloft during the more tender moments and not as is now more often the case the glow of the mobile phone I would never turn on a cell phone at any musical event wrote Roger Waters former bassist and vocalist for Pink Floyd People behind you are like put your phone down we can t see It would seem to me to show a lack of respect to and care for fellow concert goers or for that matter the artist Apart from anything else how could I possibly truly experience the thing I d paid to see and hear if I was fiddling with an iPhone filming or twittering or chatting or whatever To make matters worse the type of footage recorded at gigs tends to have as one Guardian journalist put it this week audio quality that would make Simon and Garfunkel sound like Slayer Sophisticated as it may be your smartphone s microphone is only capable of capturing anything and everything immediately around it But one company emerging from Dublin s blossoming start up scene thinks it has the answer and appears to have record labels on its side What our unique proprietary technology is able to do is take the poor quality on camera audio from fan videos and we analyse that and can see the patterns even though it s very weak and distorted explains Cathal Furey co founder of the firm 45sound The technology takes those patterns and matches it against what we call a master audio recording which would be a professional live audio recording from the same gig This clip shows original gig footage shot by a fan at a Deap Vally gig and then the same clip with fixed audio provided by 45sound From here clips are re uploaded with the high quality audio and in cases where there s more than one recording of the same moment fans watching the gig on 45sound can switch camera angles In recent years several sites have sought to make use of the swathes of fan footage recorded on a nightly basis Apps such as Vyclone have been used by the likes of Ed Sheeran to crowdsource gig footage with fans being encouraged to upload their recordings of Ed for it then to be edited together for the official music video Another start up OutListen gathers fan videos and if there s sufficient interest will go to record labels after a big show and request the professionally recorded audio But Mr Furey believes it is 45sound s audio matching software which gives it the edge over rivals meaning no human intervention is needed in order to whip the clips into a listenable state It s all completely automated he says What we re trying to build is a scaleable company I ll be happy when one day we do a thousand shows in one night Vital to this scalability is in building relationships with record labels To that end 45sound has the ear of several companies including Sony Music owned RCA Records One of their acts Bring Me The Horizon has been trialling 45sound on their latest tour prompting fans to record their show and upload it after the gig It compliments the whole marketing plan says Justin Cross head of digital marketing for RCA A lot of the artists we work with at RCA are live bands if you re watching someone s video of Bring Me The Horizon and you can see for yourself how fantastic they are live you re probably going to want to go and see them As part of their trial with 45sound Bring Me The Horizon s vocalist Oli Sykes prompts fans during the gig to record one particular song For those who hate people recording it may seem an irritating even inconsiderate request but it is somewhat tactical the 26 year old tells the BBC ahead of the band s gig in Bristol When we did it in Leeds the other day it was almost like it got it out of everyone s system Everyone filmed the song and then everyone put their cameras down and everyone got back into it so it was cool Meanwhile in the shivering cold outside the venue Bring Me The Horizon s fans are divided in their views of gig etiquette People behind you are like put your phone down we can t see says one female fan I think people kind of like just want to just get into it without standing around with your arm in the air all the time filming Another fan male has more enthusiasm towards the web s possibilities It s always good when people film it you can go on YouTube and see it and relive it and see all the people in the comments talking about it you can make more friends with that as well Comedian Marcus Brigstocke and Graham Lambert from Inspiral Carpets on phones at gigs For record companies like RCA Records it s a situation that requires delicate compromise says Mr Cross From a label perspective and my perspective as a fan it s something that s just part of a gig now you can t get away from it On one side of things it can be quite annoying for the fan that isn t into doing this but on the other side it s helping to push the band But 45sound s Mr Furey argues some events are just too good not to be widely shared I can definitely see that having a sea of cameras can ruin the experience Ultimately the most important person is the person who pays for a ticket to go and see the show At the same time I ve been at other events where my first reaction is who s videoing this Live music shows are an incredible human event they re very tribal very powerful very emotional So while the Yeah Yeah Yeahs join a select group of grumblers that includes the likes of Jarvis Cocker Jack White and the Stone Roses it is likely that the sea of cameras is here to stay and not just at gigs I have that problem in general life myself reflects Bring Me The Horizon s Mr Sykes I find a lot of people are documenting too much stuff rather than just living it", "I tried to order smartphones for my two teenage sons and an iPhone 4

are visited by millions every day were found to be installing harmful files without users knowledge Researcher Conrad Longmore found that two popular sites xhamster and pornhub posed the greatest risk Pornhub contested the findings saying they grossly exaggerate the risk Mr Longmore said it was primarily Windows users at risk but that criminals were increasingly turning their attentions to mobile devices While none of the porn sites observed hosted any malware themselves it was the embedded advertisements within their pages that created problems for users We call these malicious advertisements malvertising explained Mr Longmore The way the ads are bought and sold across all websites is incredibly complex Ads can often be repackaged and resold so that it is hard to tell where they originated from and the criminals behind them go to great lengths to disguise what they are doing Mr Longmore compiled his figures using Google s diagnostic advice service which regularly analyses websites for harmful content The data showed that xhamster listed by monitoring firm Alexa as the 46th most popular site on the internet had malvertising on 1 067 out of 20 986 pages 5 screened in the past 90 days Part of the problem is that porn is a taboo subject According to Alexa s statistics the average user of xhamster would look at 10 3 individual pages meaning a potential 42 risk of stumbling across harmful adverts in each viewing session Another site pornhub was found to have dangerous advertising on 12 7 of the 14016 pages scanned in the 90 day period In a statement pornhub owner Manwin said its figures suggest a tiny percentage 0 003 of the billions of ads it served during the 90 day period potentially carried malware Isolated incidents of malware are immediately caught and minute when considering the mammoth amount of traffic our site receives said Manwin It added that it analysed adverts before they went live and also while on the site to ensure they stayed free of malware Mr Longmore said There seems to have been a sudden spike in malware on popular sites especially in the past week or so He added that in a similar study 12 months ago the web s most popular porn site xvideos was serving up malware via banner advertising However in the more recent research the site was not found to have any harmful adverts in the time sampled by Google s system a sign the site had cleaned up Mr Longmore believes a culture of users being afraid to kick up a fuss meant many instances of malvertising go unreported Part of the problem is that porn is a taboo subject he said But the reality is that these are hugely popular sites with many of them in the top 100 most popular sites globally Some of them pull in more traffic than the BBC so this is potentially a very big issue Site operators could put a quick reporting mechanism on their sites to flag up bad ads and other concerns and ad networks should also take some responsibility here I don t see that happening any time soon and perhaps the best thing that users of these sites can do is ensure that their machines are up to date The BBC has approached the owner of xhamster but has yet to receive any comment", "By Christopher Williams Technology Correspondent in Iceland 8 00AM BST 13 Apr 2013 Comments The four week race across Antarctica will begin in mid November and test wounded military men and women to their limits The organisers hope to test modern communications technology to its limits too In some ways officials admitted during a recent training trip to an Icelandic glacier it will be a lesser challenge than the charity s expedition to the North Pole in 2011 which the Prince joined Conditions in Antarctica are more predictable the terrain is easier and the British American and Commonwealth teams will not need to battle shifting ice But the newly introduced competitive element together with a much broader variety of injuries means the journey south will be just as difficult Duncan Slater who lost both his legs to a Taliban roadside bomb aims to become the first double amputee to the South Pole The American team includes a blind special forces officer and for the first time a Walking With The Wounded expedition will include those with mental injuries Jason Wilkes for instance suffers with post traumatic stress after 19 years in the Royal Engineers He has developed a suite of coping mechanisms for the long days of trekking out on the ice he will face if selected for the British team Injured soldiers prepare for race to South Pole Prince Harry plans expedition to the South Pole Walking with the Wounded Pete McCormick of Arqiva with the Walking With The Wounded support truck in Iceland For Ed Parker the co founder of Walking With the Wounded it will all be for nothing if the charity fails to get its message out The massive profile boost provided by Prince Harry s patronage will this year be backed by a technological effort designed to increase public awareness of the expedition as well as improve logistics out on the ice It s really important that we get this right he said as the teams ran through their drills for the last time on the Langjokull glacier For the first time people are going to be able to track the guys online in real time and stay in touch with the expedition It s one of the things we really wanted to improve compared to the North Pole The communications technology and expertise will be provided by Arqiva the firm that runs Britain s television and radio masts Bascially the only game for communications in Antarctica is the Iridium network explained Pete McCormick an Arqiva engineer and former army communications specialist who was in Iceland testing the technology the teams will use later this year It s tried and tested Iridium is a network of 66 satellites that provide full coverage of the Earth for voice calls and crucially for Walking With The Wounded data The charity plans to use the network to upload pictures video diaries tweets and more The North Pole expedition attempted same feats but was frustrated by interruptions as their data link hoped from one Iridium satellite to another said Parker The satellites are in a fast low orbit so the handover occurs about every 50 seconds Sending large video files was impossible This time special software running on a 12 volt server in a support truck will be able to pick up where it left off with the previous satellite Uploading video in HD quality will take time over the 128 kbits per second connection even with the specialist compression software that will be used But the new stability means there are even plans for the winning team to do a live webcast when they reach the South Pole One of the biggest problems for all the technology the teams will rely on and particularly the satellite phone handsets they will carry to stay in touch with the support trucks and home is battery life We re a bit constrained by the laws of physics said Pete McCormick Lithium ion batteries just don t like the cold On the Langjokull glacier a fully charged handset left outside a tent lost 80 per cent of its power The teams have been trained to keep their phones cosy and spares will be on hand Next time we might go somewhere warm said Parker", "Micro blogging site Twitter is rumoured to be launching a new music service after buying the music discovery site We Are

to elaborate on that No Go on please OK way back in 2003 the Winklevii along with a Harvard classmate developed a university based social network called HarvardConnection then claimed that fellow student Mark Zuckerburg appropriated both their idea and their source code to create Facebook And then they sued him Exactly After four years of legal wrangling they finally reached a 65m settlement And then the Winklevoss twins lived happily ever after No then they sued Facebook again claiming the stock portion of the settlement had been undervalued This second effort was not successful If they can t make a living suing people how will the Winklevoss twins survive On Bitcoin Come again Surely you ve heard of Bitcoin the digital virtual currency beloved of speculators and online drug dealers

airwaves which in June generated 2 3bn a total of 1 2bn less than the Treasury had forecast and 3bn less than the theoretical maximum In a letter seen by the Guardian the NAO s auditor general Amyas Morse told the Labour MP Helen Goodman shadow minister for media and communications I intend to conduct a value for money study of Ofcom s recent auction of 4G spectrum The Treasury s forecast of 3 5bn to be raised in the auction was included in the government finances at the time of the autumn statement last December and allowed the chancellor George Osborne to claim that government borrowing was falling The Guardian understands that the NAO is now preparing the terms of an investigation after complaints from Goodman who pointed to remarks by the Ofcom chief executive Ed Richards indicating that the government had not made maximising revenues the prime aim of the auction By not making maximising the auction s revenues an objective for Ofcom the government has failed to get value for money on this project Goodman complained to Morse The 4G auction sold off more radio spectrum than ever before to bidders including the four main mobile networks and BT By comparison the 3G auction in April 2000 raised 22 5bn Figures published by Ofcom in March showed that the highest bids for 4G spectrum came to a total of 5 2bn But Ofcom said those were only theoretical because it was using a rule whereby winners only paid slightly more than the second highest bidder similar to an eBay auction a measure taken to make the auctions harder to rig Goodman said she welcomed the NAO s intervention It is entirely right that the National Audit Office has launched this investigation Serious questions must be answered as to why the Conservative led government ended up 1bn short of the estimate George Osborne had provided just months earlier When the 3G auction took place Labour ensured that maximising revenue was an objective The Conservative led government did not do the same for the 4G auction which I believe was a serious mistake Some sources at bidders felt that the design of the auction using a system known as combinatorial clock which has been used in other countries to sell off 4G airwaves not only worked against maximising revenue but was also unsatisfactory for bidders Ofcom neither raised the amount that the government was looking for nor did it ensure that spectrum found its way into the hands of everybody who wanted it one bidder told the Guardian when the figures were released Their dissatisfaction could also become part of the study Morse told Goodman that Ofcom had a responsibility to ensure that the auction delivered an economically efficient allocation of spectrum The allocation after the auction means that Vodafone s share of all UK

of the auction a report from the study expected to last some months will go to the Commons public accounts committee which in turn can censure the government and demand a response from Osborne Ofcom defended the auction design as benefiting consumers A spokesman said The 4G auction was a success which will deliver the maximum benefit to UK citizens and consumers in line with Ofcom s statutory duties It will create competition with five companies able to launch competitive 4G services This will lead to investment in new services greater innovation and lower prices plus enhanced coverage with a rule to cover almost all of the UK population by 2017 at the latest The auction was designed to promote competition and ensure coverage rather than to raise money These benefits will deliver

Gears of War grizzled gun toting hero Marcus Fenix sweeps team mate Dom Santiago into a tender embrace and the pair kiss passionately as the credits roll It s fantasy of course Not only in the context of the imaginary worlds that provide much of video gaming s currency but also in the uncomfortable reality that would make such a relatively innocuous event almost unthinkable in a game released today Fenix is inevitably in a heterosexual relationship within the game a snapshot of the underwhelming job the industry is doing of presenting the diversity of its audience in the titles it produces The majority of game protagonists are still straight white and male whereas the audience is increasingly more diverse explains Mitu Khandaker independent developer at The Tiniest Shark Besides the question of who developers perceive their audience to be game protagonists are simply not representative enough of people in the real world she adds Unfortunately a disappointingly overwhelming amount of the time non white female or LGBT characters in games do little more than parrot existing media stereotypes particularly within mainstream games Khandaker touches on an important point as video games have begun to mature as an art form they have adopted the same lazy cliches that long dominated film and television Women are often to be rescued or ogled non white characters are sidekicks or villains gay people are invisible or caricatures However games are still at a stage in their development comparable to the movie industry of the 1930s As cinema grew and matured slowly tackling more complex themes and appealing to wider audiences so too must gaming challenge its own inherent biases Part of the problem may be the players themselves or at least a segment of the player base that is vocally resistant to change Mainstream fan communities tend to be overly hostile when diversity issues are brought up and I feel that they tend to get much more hostile and abusive when the person bringing up the issue is a member of a minority demographic says Regina Buenaobra North American online community team leader for Guild Wars developer ArenaNet Games are meeting the needs of straight white male gamers but when others say that their needs aren t being met they just can t empathise A market that doesn t cater to them is beyond their experience To larger publishers dealing with high budget titles carrying considerable financial risk this creates a mixed message the familiar core audience seemingly decrying change while an untapped one demands visibility Without speaking for others I think there s a fear of exclusion rather than an appreciation for the opportunity for inclusion says Noah Hughes creative director on the recently rebooted Tomb Raider They might be losing people by making these choices as opposed to flipping it around and seeing that you can invite more people to have these experiences The issue of representation has drawn increasing focus over the last 12 months from those working in the industry At last month s Game Developers Conference in California the subject was a key talking point Microsoft s Tom Abernathy went as far as stating that women are the new core and called for greater diversity in games saying Our industry our art and our business stand to gain in every sense simply by holding a mirror up to our audience and reflecting their diversity in what we produce Promisingly parts of the mainstream industry are already heading in that direction Telltale Games episodic adaptation of The Walking Dead won near universal acclaim last year for its emotional clout and sympathetic cast including black lead Lee Everett and developers at Sony s Naughty Dog studio fought for co lead Ellie to be prominently featured on box art for forthcoming post apocalyptic thriller The Last of Us Elsewhere Capcom s impending sci fi action title Remember Me introduces Nilin a mixed race woman I want to keep faith in humanity and in the fact that gender doesn t matter when a protagonist is created Remember Me s creative director Jean Maxime Moris says We are in 2013 It is high time game companies noticed what has been happening in other forms of storytelling in the past couple of thousands of years In the world and the story of Remember Me the only choice we had was to go with Nilin We didn t consider having a male character and we hope she resonates well with players from all ages and countries The calls for diversity in games have never been greater and though smaller independent studios are better positioned to capitalise the bigger more monolithic companies are likely to find it harder to ignore the demand It may be a while yet before a mainstream shooter is bold enough to subvert macho expectations with a gay lead but the visibility of types other than the straight white male is increasing and that can only be a good thing for the industry the medium and of course the players The Longest Journey Funcom 2000 presents leading lady April Ryan a directionless young artist as an intelligent flawed and realistic human being April s fantasy adventure also explores themes of youth responsibility and growing up Of note is the game s portrayal of supporting characters Fiona and Mickey a pair of middle aged lesbians in a committed relationship Its sequel Dreamfall Funcom 2007 introduced new heroes Zo Castillo a young woman of mixed Chinese and Spanish descent and Kian Alvane a black apostle raised in a matriarchal religious society while further exploring April s destiny On the surface Catherine Atlus 2011 seems to be little more than Japanese fanservice but look closer and you ll find a mature exploration of sex obsession and psychosis that also presents one of the few transgender characters in games

according to the GSMA which brings together global mobile operators handset makers and internet providers Very few funds if any would appear to disburse all that they collect it said Less than 12 5 of the funds are meeting their own targets Universal service funds USF are set up by levies on telecoms in individual countries which are then used to increase consumer access based on criteria such as income distribution rural and urban population ratios literacy and geography But the GSMA report estimates that more than one third of the 64 funds surveyed have yet to disburse any of the contributions they have collected Our research shows that despite the fact that there is an ever increasing amount of money sitting unused in these funds governments continue to collect still more from the mobile operators said Tom Phillips the chief regulatory officer at GSMA The situation needs urgent government review and attention as the money collected to date far exceeds the amount that is needed to ensure universal access Among the funds dubbed by the GSMA as ineffective or severely constrained and or legally challenged are those set up in Brazil the Czech Republic Ecuador France and Italy The Indian USF for example contains more than 4bn in unspent money but still imposes a 5 levy on operator revenues The USFs in Afghanistan Bolivia South Africa and the US have been accused

jostle by dressed as jockeys Italian tourists stare anxiously at their smartphones looking for Piccadilly Circus And outside the Gielgud theatre where Helen Mirren is about to step on stage as the Queen in Peter Morgan s hit play The Audience a man named George is trying to flog me a pair of tickets at a hugely inflated price Fifty pounds each George says I ask how much he paid for them and he says 10 I need to make a living love It s a great show Helen Mirren s in it I say I know and ask the best price he s received for a ticket His eyes narrow Is that any of your business he says I admit it s probably not but he tells me anyway 150 138 more than the cheapest tickets sold by the Gielgud No thanks I say and he shrugs and turns away Scenes like this are nothing new as long as there have been large ticketed gatherings with a limited number of seats there have been touts looking to cash in You can picture a man just like George dressed in a toga flogging marked up tickets to gladiatorial battles at the Roman Colosseum you can certainly see men like him lining the pavements outside major music concerts Touts are a less frequent sight outside West End theatres than they are at gigs but with a remarkable number of hot ticket shows opening since the new year all within a few hundred feet of one another touts activities seem to have increased in intensity Just down the road from the Gielgud at the Prince of Wales there s the taboo busting musical The Book of Mormon opposite at the Apollo there s The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time recently transferred from the National Theatre and Judi Dench is starring in Peter and Alice around the corner on St Martin s Lane Last month Baz Bamigboye of the Daily Mail reported seeing a tout George perhaps selling tickets for The Audience at 500 a pair These are shows people are desperate to see the tout explained and we haven t had that for a while The Guardian s theatre critic Michael Billington told me he saw several touts operating outside The Book of Mormon on press night I can t see any there on the night I m in town perhaps they ve been scared off by the burly security guard but box office attendant Danielle Oxley confirms that touts are a problem We get the same guys coming back trying to snap up the cheapest tickets she says We know they re going to try to sell them on at a higher price The trouble is that people are tempted to buy from them because they really are desperate to see the show We get people coming up to us crying because they can t get in But the issue of theatre ticket touting goes beyond the streets The real problem lies online with resale sites like Get Me In Viagogo and Seatwave where tickets are often advertised at inflated prices Purchased through Delfont Mackintosh the company that owns both the Gielgud and the Prince of Wales theatres premium rate tickets for The Audience and The Book of Mormon cost 127 That s high enough but last week Mark Shenton of the Stage reported finding a pair of tickets on sale for The Book of Mormon on Viagogo for just over 720 including taxes and fees I looked at the tickets available on these sites for three shows The Audience The Book of Mormon and Peter and Alice for Saturday 11 May On Get Me In two stalls tickets for The Book of Mormon were advertised at 275 each But the biggest mark ups came with Peter and Alice The three resale sites had no tickets for Saturday 11 May but all of them had stall tickets available for Thursday 9 May for 199 98 excluding fees Purchased through the theatre these would have cost between 59 50 and 87 with fees included These sites are perfectly legal and most of them are clear about the face value of the tickets they re selling So what s the problem with buying from them Well there s the fact that the theatres themselves don t see a penny of the mark up Last year playwright Richard Bean went so far as to say that the issue of internet touting was putting people off the West End and diverting money from the people who should be getting it The truth is he said the creatives who would normally get a cut are not getting any of that inflated price and the money is not going back into theatre Julian Bird chief executive of the Society of London Theatre which represents theatre owners and producers said at the time that touting is now the single biggest issue facing theatreland He doesn t think the issue has got any worse but he urges theatregoers only to buy from theatres and agents registered with the Society of Ticket Agents and Retailers Star whose members are prevented from reselling tickets at a profit None of the websites I looked at are Star registered although Get Me In is owned by Ticketmaster which is There will always be shows where demand outstrips supply Bird says But it s important to point out that theatres always have tickets available for as little as 10 or 12 whether they re day tickets or tickets released right at the beginning of the run When shows like The Audience and The Book of Mormon are charging 127 for tickets that might seem like scant solace But the West End operates on a commercial basis producers can charge as much as they think people are willing to pay The waters only really become muddied with shows like Matilda The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time and Richard Bean s One Man Two Guvnors which were originally produced at subsidised theatres and therefore perhaps have more of a duty to provide tickets at reasonable prices These shows make a considerable effort to provide such tickets which are then thwarted by touting When Bean criticised the online touts he was mainly expressing his frustration with the fact that the producers of One Man Two Guvnors tried offering 15 gallery seats but found they were being sold on at a higher price Ticket reselling tugs at a moralistic urge inside some of us says Jonathan Brown secretary of Star We have a sense that it must be wrong We are clearly seeing excesses happening but the fact is it s legal and it s a busy marketplace Brown can see theatres moving towards the dynamic pricing model used by airlines where ticket prices vary according to availability This seems to already be in action at The Book of Mormon tickets went up in price the day after the show s successful opening night But Brown believes that such high prices can actually be seen as positive At least he says that way the theatre rather than the tours can profit from the fact that some people will always be willing to pay these prices Ultimately this all points towards the fact that the health of commercial theatre in London is very good and that s good news", "Teenager Nick D Aloisio hit the headlines last month when an app he had developed was bought by Yahoo for millions of pounds I interviewed Nick 13 months ago at his home in Wimbledon in south London and it was obvious he came from a successful wealthy family who had opted to give him a private education A day after Nick started counting his millions an email dropped in my inbox about another teenaged developer Schoolboy Tom Humphrey has launched an app designed to help language learning by combining dictionary definitions with digital translation tools He also happens to go to Eton College Meanwhile teenager Nina Dewani who was interviewed by the BBC last month after designing a password prompting app attends a private school in St Albans It could be a coincidence but these young people join a long line of tech entrepreneurs who attended private schools and found fame for their creations Sir Tim Berners Lee went to an independent school as did Bill Gates although he later dropped out of Harvard to set up a software company while child prodigy Mark Zuckerberg had a tutor who helped him start writing software It is from public schools such as Eton that the current prime minister and many leaders of industry have emerged so it should perhaps come as no great surprise that the entrepreneurs of the future are also learning there Tom thinks his winning app design was down to him as an individual rather than the famous school he goes to but he acknowledged that it played a part The school didn t push me to enter the competition but once I had entered they helped me There are brilliant facilities here he said If you show interest in something there are people that are going to help you The school gave me the freedom to develop the app he added Mark McGinn who organised the O2 Think Big AppSkool competition that Tom won thinks the 17 year old succeeded on his own merits but recognises that school can play an important role There is no doubt that private schools offer the opportunity to touch success and inspire a certain mindset and a willingness to take risks he said The horizon at these schools is just bigger If you are fortunate enough to be in a classroom where some of the parents are heads of industry you are going to be inspired he added At 15 30 when the bell goes in a state school the kids are out of the door Very few are staying behind doing innovative things It is an issue that Dr Tony Sewell founder of Generating Genius is determined to tackle He set up the charity with the specific intention of getting children from disadvantaged backgrounds into universities to study the Stem subjects of Science Technology Engineering and Maths Public schoolboys dominate sports arts and the technology section Dr Sewell told the BBC Private schools have a culture of independent thinking they give students a sense that they are knowledgeable and confident In comprehensives it is the reverse to be ignorant is to be the star he added The fact that few children from disadvantaged backgrounds take up Stem subjects at university is something that needs urgent focus It is something that state schools need to address We are losing talent Partly the issue is a cultural one he thinks While a child perceived as a geek at a state comprehensive may be bullied he says in a private school that child is more likely to be nurtured and encouraged The culture of competition is at the heart of the public school as are clubs and societies said Dr Sewell At 15 30 when the bell goes in a state school the kids are out of the door Very few are staying behind doing innovative things he says At a recent competition for schools to come up with clever uses for the Raspberry Pi the ultra cheap micro controller there was a dearth of entries from state schools It was something that worried the judges including the BBC s own technology correspondent Rory Cellan Jones One theory offered as to why was that the constraints of the curriculum meant teachers were too cautious about committing to time consuming projects which might not contribute directly to exam results he said Prof Stephen Heppell an education expert determined to transform the curriculum agrees Schools need to get away from half hour lesson blocks especially with computer science he said No sooner have you got started than it is time to stop To write a good program you need a good block of time half a day at least He is convinced there is no shortage of talent in the state sector and if most of the app developers making the headlines at the moment come from fee paying schools it might just be down to their parents They may have the money to spend on getting the app to market or getting marketing for it he said The nature of entrepreneurship is such that someone with a good idea and enough determination can become successful whatever their background And with tools such as the Raspberry Pi available to all technology is certainly not the preserve of schools such as Eton Programming too has become easier meaning the teenage app developer is here to stay says Prof Heppell What is scarce now isn t so much programming skills but good ideas and kids are awash with good ideas And he says some of the best are likely to come from children at state schools They have better ideas because they have a better sense of what the world needs", "By Sarah Rainey 10 00PM BST 11 Apr 2013 Comments If you tuned in to

last night s Horizon special wasn t a return to the BBC s flagship science show Instead it was a one off snapshot of the inventions and discoveries transforming life in the 21st century Sound exciting I thought so But the hour that followed was more confusing than anything else Presented by Liz Bonnin the Irish one off Stargazing Live the show whizzed through four areas of science that are changing our world space biotechnology materials and energy From a 20 million race to the moon to making ethanol from genetically modified bacteria levitating frogs and drugs that are spun in a candyfloss machine barely a minute passed without another astonishing revelation We met Andre Geim the Nobel Prize winning physicist who discovered graphene a material so strong that a hammock just one atom thick would hold a cat using a roll of Sellotape Then there was Cesar Harada who builds remote controlled boats to clean up oil spills Michael Pritchard founder of Lifesaver Systems which uses sewage technology to purify water and Prof Bob Langer whose tissue regeneration work has helped 100 million cancer sufferers It was a whirlwind approach and not one that lent itself to understanding complex areas of science There was a sense the show was trying too hard to impress jumping about from experiment to experiment in a bid to capture a younger audience Bonnin spent most of the programme striding around an aircraft hangar looking like Lara Croft The experts she spoke to were mostly trendy leather jacket wearing bloggers and tech writers There were some redeeming features A highlight was watching the experts trying to define ridiculously named specialisms including quantum optics and plasma physics nope no idea And it was refreshing to see so many female scientists on screen

screen The firm suggested its size made it ideal for watching videos or running two apps alongside each other Samsung helped popularise the so called phablet category in which phones approach tablet dimensions with its original 5 3in Galaxy Note in 2011 That proved more popular than many expected but one analyst suggested the latest device might be a step too far Samsung is marketing the Android powered handset as having a high definition screen however a spokesman was unable to confirm whether it supported 720p or the full HD 1080p resolution Another South Korean firm Pantech currently lays claim to offering the biggest full HD smartphone with its 5 9in Vega No 6 which was announced in January China s Huawei had previously boasted having the biggest largest screened 720p smartphone with its 6 1in Ascend Mate Samsung also makes the Galaxy Note 8 0 Some versions of this 8in screened device feature an HSPA radio allowing them to make calls but the machine is being promoted as a tablet with phone functionality rather than the other way round Samsung suggested that despite its dimensions the Galaxy Mega was still small and light enough at 199g 0 44lb to fit into users pockets and be used with one hand However the firm is hedging its bets by offering a smaller 5 8in screened version as an alternative Both will go on sale in May with Europe and Russia the first regions to be offered the devices Tech consultancy Davies Murphy Group said that within the Android market there had been a notable shift towards people wanting to buy a single device rather than both a smartphone and tablet However its principal technology analyst Chris Green suggested that at 6 3in it would be a folly for most users to swap their current handsets for the larger of the two Galaxy Megas There is genuine demand for larger smartphones the problem is at what point does a smartphone turn into a tablet he told the BBC When you ve got this up against your head you d have to argue you re using a tablet and not a smartphone it s definitely going to compromise its functionality because it s simply too big and too cumbersome to use as a traditional telephone device But ignoring the phone functionality as far as the rest of the smart device goes it looks quite phenomenal Samsung was the most popular smartphone maker in 2012 accounting for 30 3 of all shipments according to analysts at

to introduce goal line technology from the 2013 14 season British based Hawk Eye has been awarded the contract to provide the system Hawk Eye uses seven cameras per goal to detect the ball and claims its system is millimetre accurate ensuring no broadcast replays could disprove the decision 1 Seven fast frame cameras located above and around each goal such as on a stadium s roof track the ball s movement within the goal area 2 Computer software analyses information from all the cameras and as soon as it detects the ball has crossed the goal line sends a signal to the official s watch The result can be relayed within one second and is said to be millimetre accurate 3 Hawk Eye can also provide definitive replays to TV outlets The Football Association will install a system at Wembley Stadium in time for August s Community Shield Top flight clubs voted to adopt the system during a meeting of the 20 Premier League chairmen on Thursday Hawk Eye is known for providing tennis and cricket with ball tracking technology Its football system notifies the referee if the ball has crossed the goal line via a vibration and optical signal sent to the officials watches within one second Inventor Paul Hawkins said It will not slow the game down it is not going to become like rugby In under a second we will provide the information to the watch then afterwards we will show a TV replay that will definitively prove what we showed the referee was correct Football s a great game It does not need enhancements to add to the drama Our technology is there to ensure decisions are correct England manager Roy Hodgson welcomed the Premier League s move saying it would prevent gross injustices affecting results It is something that people in football have wanted for a long time There s been a big debate and for a while it was pushed back but now everyone s on the same page and we ve introduced it said Hodgson At least it will stop some of those gross injustices that we have seen in recent years where goals have obviously been scored and not allowed Once work is under way installation of the system for the 17 Premier League clubs who avoid relegation and the three teams promoted from the Football League is expected to take up to six weeks to complete Richard Scudamore chief executive of the Premier League added When these incidents come along they are so controversial so seismic that it is all about getting it right Some involved in the game hope that this is the start of a technological revolution Off side decisions and contentious fouls could also benefit from video analysis something that Fifa insist will not happen But many believe that the game has opened Pandora s box by approving systems for goal line decisions While English football looks set to embrace change the Champions League will continue to live without digital help as the European football authority Uefa remains ideologically opposed to its use And that s something that looks set to persist for as long as Michel Platini remains as its president If there is some technology available to help the officials get it right then it is right we should be doing it Stoke City chairman Peter Coates also welcomed the decision but was wary about whether the use of technology should be extended to look at other areas such as offside decisions I think we should be careful he said The great thing about our game is that it should be simple free flowing and that it carries on We don t want to become like a rugby game so I m probably in favour of simplicity and keeping a lot as it is West Ham co owner David Gold was open minded on further use of the technology He said It s a start who knows where it will take us Fans will have a big say in this and also TV will have a big say We want to take the big bad decisions out of football and this kind of technology will do that It s been a good day for football Momentum for the introduction of goal line technology increased after Ukraine were denied an equaliser when the ball appeared to cross the line in a 1 0 defeat by England at Euro 2012 Gross injustices will stop Hodgson The following month the International Football Association Board IFAB in Zurich approved two systems for use in the sport At this time the Premier League said it wanted to see its introduction as soon as is practically possible After the IFAB vote Fifa president Sepp Blatter said Frank Lampard s ghost goal at the 2010 World Cup played a decisive role in the decision Lampard s goal came when England were 2 1 down in the second round against Germany Fabio Capello s team went on to lose 4 1 Lampard welcomed the Premier League s decision saying It s a no brainer It s been a long time coming but they got here in the end It s a simple thing that will bring

computer industry titan from slipping away into irrelevance But when she visited London the focus was bound to be on one of the worst decisions HP has ever made its acquisition of the British technology firm Autonomy in 2011 Last November HP took an 8 8bn 5bn write down on the value of Autonomy a business for which it had paid roughly 11bn At the same time the firm and its CEO launched an extraordinary attack on the Cambridge based software firm s former management team accusing them of misrepresenting the value of the business and of accounting irregularities Mike Lynch the firm s founder rejected the charges and accused HP in turn of destroying his software business through its own ineptitude The whole affair is now in the hands of the regulators and the courts So was it wise to pick such a public fight last November It was necessary Meg Whitman told me this morning She repeated HP s claims to a US court saying there had been very serious strategic misrepresentations accounting improprieties and when we understood what had happened we had to explain to our investors Obviously the huge write down had to be explained somehow to investors But the suspicion among some has been that the charges of impropriety were a convenient smokescreen to cover a simple truth that HP had paid far too much in its desperation to land the deal Even on the day the deal was announced I wrote that one extremely sceptical analyst told the CEO Leo Apotheker he was paying a fantastic price Meg Whitman was not in charge at the time but was on the board and in our interview she came pretty close to admitting that HP had overpaid with or without any accounting shenanigans She insisted a big chunk of the write down had been due to what emerged about the company after the purchase But what about the rest of it One person close to the former management of Autonomy said even HP s allegations about questionable accounting only added up to 100m in misclassified sales It s impossible to get from a revenue misclassification of 100m dollars a year to a writedown of 5bn Last week one HP figure did pay the price for the disastrous deal Chairman Raymond Lane resigned and that gives the CEO some breathing space Meg Whitman has always said it will be a long job turning around HP but she told me she d made a lot of progress She d won the hearts and minds of HP s 300 000 strong workforce to her strategy the company had the best product line we ve had in a decade while innovation was alive and well If so that message has yet to be communicated to the outside world It s hard to think of any standout products that would get customers thinking of HP as a great innovator The CEO admitted customers hadn t said that for a while but promised that in the next six months that would change with its new line of Moonshot servers and its enterprise security software In six months I bet people will say wow I didn t know HP had all this The most obvious change she s made since taking over is to squash the idea that HP should spin off its core PC business which has been badly left behind in the move to mobile computing She recognised the need to compete in a world which has been transformed by always on touchscreen devices of all shapes and sizes So was there going to be a mobile phone We want to What we haven t figured out yet is how to do that without it just being a me too product and losing a lot of money which I m not interested in doing Given its recent history you can see why HP s boss might be cautious about spraying money around to little effect But if she s to make the business a technology leader again rather than managing its decline Meg Whitman needs to come up with a standout product pretty soon", "Price 24 995MPG 36 2Top speed 140mph These days admitting that you actually enjoy driving can raise a few eyebrows Like fell running or ferreting it s seen as the preserve of the unrefined mind a pastime for simple folk who still think going fast is a thrill Honestly how unreconstructed If I tell someone I love cars because I love driving I have to accompany it with a shrug of incomprehension as if to say I know how weird And did you know I like eating Vaseline too But there are obviously a few of us out there because why else would Toyota have dared to build a car like the GT86 It s a full bore unmitigated back to basics driver s coup a car that celebrates the most elemental pleasure of firing up an engine engaging the gearbox and accelerating Over the past several decades what manufacturers call progress has been nothing more than an attempt to make driving less like driving and cars less like cars Open the bonnet today and you can t even see the engine let alone get your hands dirty and oil over the front of your trousers Modern cars are opened with a bleep on a fob turned on with the push of a button You don t have to change gear or turn on the lights or wipers You don t have to worry about losing traction or getting cold You can t hear the engine or the road You are insulated isolated a bit numbed Of course it s all bloody brilliant But occasionally you should sit in a car that reminds you just how incredible a propulsive car can be We ve had wild swimming maybe this should be called wild driving And that s where the GT86 comes in Toyota has a bit of form when it comes to sporting coup s It s given us the Celica Supra and the brilliant mid engined MR2 And it s now rolled out the GT86 It s the result of a joint venture between Subaru and Toyota Subaru s version which is exactly the same is called the BRZ It s up to you to decide which you think sounds cooler The GT86 or if you wish the BRZ isn t going to stop the show with its looks Yes it s pretty but it s not a stunner From the front it has elegant wing bulges and a low scooping open grill round the back it boasts two handsome chrome tail pipes and nicely cut lights it s nothing you haven t seen before Inside things are more promising It has bucket seats a stitched red steering wheel and a stubby matching gearstick There are two back seats but they are tiny Although I did manage to get two lanky teenage boys in there sort of flatpacked Start up the four cylinder petrol engine and you begin to realise what all the fuss is about Squeeze the throttle and the engine note builds The rear wheel drive and instant steering make it feel snappy the power comes in snatches There s nothing smooth about the ride It bounces over speed bumps as if it has no suspension at all My wife hated sitting in the passenger seat But once you get out on to a long snaky road the growl in your throat starts to match that coming from the engine It really does fly this little car Fast flat balanced light and lithe it s addictive A touch on the wheel and you whip from side to side It s basic but the engineers have been smart enough to create a car that flatters your driving An hour at the wheel and you start to channel your inner James Hunt Many of our rivals have turbos big tyres and four wheel drive says Yoshi Sasaki of Toyota They have become sports cars that control their own behaviour they have become boring Until now The RAC is to turn the breakdown industry on its head this year with the launch of its magic box for members which will remotely communicate with base to provide diagnostic information which could potentially identify certain vehicle faults before they result in a stressful and inconvenient breakdown The revolutionary RAC Advance early warning system builds on current telematics technology but utilises the latest diagnostic software to build a comprehensive picture of how a car s systems are performing In the event of a breakdown it will alert the RAC s response team who can remotely connect with its onboard diagnostic software to identify the fault and give an accurate location for the motorist enabling the rescue service to swiftly despatch a patrol pre armed with the diagnosis and the appropriate repair solution or parts or order up a recovery vehicle if the problem cannot be fixed at the roadside The simple device the size of a matchbox can be self installed in minutes and can be accessed via a mobile app on the driver s phone or tablet enabling them to check multiple levels of performance including their own driver score accurate taxman friendly mileage records GPS tracking and other key information The RAC is keen to conduct extensive consumer testing on its system and will be recruiting a team of 1 000 members to put RAC Advance through its paces on UK roads you can

had a volatile 24 hours that saw values plummet hack attacks trading shutdowns and bitcoin stealing malware From the high of 260 169 for each bitcoin on 10 April bitcoins are now worth less than 100 65 each The main bitcoin exchange shut down for 12 hours to install hardware to help it cope with trading volumes In addition malicious software is emerging that seeks out and empties the virtual wallets of bitcoin owners MTGox on which most bitcoin trading takes place was overwhelmed earlier this week by the amount of people who joined the exchange to trade the virtual cash The computer problems prompted a round of panic selling that forced values to plunge The exchange went offline to beef up its hardware to cope with trading volumes and stem the fall in value However soon after trading resumed the site came under a sustained hack attack which saw it bombarded with data In a tweet MTGox said the it was being hit by a stronger than usual attack It went offline again to avoid the attack and when it re started bitcoins continued to fall in value Early on 12 April each bitcoin was worth about 90 58 Owners of bitcoins have also become the target of cyber thieves keen to cash in on the boom in the digital currency A phishing gang posted a message to the discussion forum of a website used by many bitcoin traders saying MTGox was about to start trading litecoins an alternative to bitcoins In the message was a link that supposedly connected to an official MTGox chat site In fact the site that people were taken to if they clicked on the link was fake and via a booby trapped update file installed malicious software that then emptied digital wallets of bitcoins At least one trader was hit in the attack and lost 34 bitcoins as a result In a post about the theft posted to the Bitcointalk forum the victim said he was stupid not to have taken more trouble to stay safe but added This is a serious loss for me and unless this is handled correctly this can also badly affect the community It has also emerged that Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss who famously sued Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg claiming they had the original idea for the social network have substantial bitcoin holdings In an interview with the New York Times the pair said they owned about 11m of the virtual coins about 1 of the global supply", "By Rick Maybury 7 00AM BST 14 Apr 2013
