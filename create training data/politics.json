["Hundreds of protesters have joined MSPs and union leaders at a march in Glasgow against nuclear weapons Organisers the Scrap Trident Coalition led campaigners through Glasgow city centre before holding a rally in George Square Campaigners want to see the UK government dispose of nuclear weapons The Trident missile system Britain s nuclear deterrent is carried by submarines based at the Faslane naval base on the Clyde near Helensburgh Police say up to 1 000 protesters were at the march which is part of a weekend of events with workshops remaining in George Square on Sunday Some activists aim to stage a further protest on Monday by forming a blockade outside Faslane The Scrap Trident Coalition said 29 MSPs supported their campaign The SNP backs the removal of Trident from Scottish waters but changed its policy last year to support membership of Nato in the event of a Yes vote in the referendum in September next year Scottish Greens leader Patrick Harvie said A debate led by the Scottish Greens in the last session of parliament resulted in a historic vote against the renewal of Trident and we continue to call for communities reliant on military jobs to be helped to diversify It is vital that those of us who want to see Trident scrapped also make the case against outdated overblown military budgets and pro nuclear clubs like Nato An independent Scotland that took a different tack from the UK would send a very powerful message to the international community about the folly of military aggression The president of teachers union the Educational Institute of Scotland Susan Quinn will attend the rally She said The EIS is a long standing affiliate of the campaign for nuclear disarmament and are happy to support any opportunity to raise issues around Trident We see the ongoing funding of this project as a waste of public money especially in times of harsh cuts to spending in all areas of the public sector Meanwhile the Church of Scotland s Sally Foster Fulton convener of the church and society council sent a message of support ahead of the march She said The Church of Scotland has been against nuclear weapons and in favour of unilateral disarmament for over four decades Scotland stands at a pivotal place in history and regardless of the outcome of the referendum now is the time to discuss debate and decide what kind of nation we want to be what kind of nation we want to leave as a legacy to our children and theirs Is a world burdened with the scourge of nuclear weapons a place we want to live in and leave behind They are a profound evil and their potential for irretrievable harm is immense", "Labour must offer solutions to voters problems if it is to be seen as an effective party of government ex Home Secretary Lord Reid has said He said

politics built on grievance But Mr Miliband has insisted he is setting out a vision for the future Labour currently holds opinion poll leads over the Conservatives but in recent days some prominent figures have questioned the direction of Mr Miliband s leadership Former Prime Minister Tony Blair said the party should not simply become the repository for people s anger against the coalition s spending cuts Mr Blunkett a close ally of Mr Blair argues in an article for the Observer that Mr Miliband s stated aim of making Labour a one nation party should be about a great deal more than politics built on grievance and the unhappiness of a resentful and selfish public sphere It should also be more than putting right the playing off of public sector workers against those in private enterprise he adds Labour is carrying out a series of policy reviews ahead of writing its manifesto for the next general election in 2015 At the last election in 2010 the party had its worst showing since 1983 Speaking on BBC One s Sunday Politics Lord Reid said Labour had to move from being a voice of protest to being a voice of solutions as we move from being an effective opposition to an effective party of government He said the party should set out the direction of a future Labour government on questions like welfare and the economy and housing and so on Lord Reid said there was a sense that that s started to happen but added It s important to recognise that we need solutions and not just criticise the status quo Mr Miliband should adapt Labour s values to modern circumstances he argued However Lord Reid admitted that much of Mr Miliband s work in setting out a clear position and direction would remain difficult until the party got back into government saying The proof of the pudding is in the eating as Blair Thatcher and other great leaders have shown Following Mr Blair s comments Mr Miliband said the party was moving forward but said the previous Labour government had got some things wrong and that he wanted to assess where it got things wrong listen to the electorate and sketch out a different vision for the future", "Labour leader Ed Miliband has had an operation to reset a wrist which he broke 10 days ago while hill walking with his wife Justine in Devon A spokesman said the fracture was discovered on Friday when Mr Miliband had an X ray at the A E department of University College Hospital London Mr Miliband returned to the hospital on Saturday for the minor operation It is understood the 43 year old needed painkillers during Wednesday s Commons debate on Baroness Thatcher The spokesman said he was back home with his family The injury would not stop him attending the funeral of Lady Thatcher on Wednesday the spokesman added", "Margaret Thatcher s policies as prime minister changed many aspects of British life and were collectively called Thatcherism But what does the term mean A handful of political leaders are influential enough to have an ism after their name But no political philosophy has shaped a nation in quite the same way as Thatcherism At its most crude Thatcherism represents a belief in free markets and a small state Rather than planning and regulating business and people s lives government s job is to get out of the way It should be restricted to the bare essentials defence of the realm and the currency Everything else should be left to individuals to exercise their own choices and take responsibility for their own lives This was a revolutionary even dangerous notion to most postwar politicians Central planning of industry and society had helped win the war The only way to win the peace it was believed by the leaders of both the Labour and Conservative parties was to plan and control industry vast swathes of which were owned by the state Margaret Thatcher was not alone in rejecting state ownership of businesses and socialist central planning Like other right wingers of her generation she had been influenced by The Road to Serfdom by Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek which warned of the danger of tyranny that inevitably results from government control of economic decision making through central planning But Hayek s brand of free market economics was deeply out of favour in the 1950s and 1960s It was only when the country had been crippled by industrial strife and decline that it began to look like a credible alternative Thatcher belonged to a Conservative Party faction headed by Keith Joseph who were followers of Hayek s Austrian school of economics and were also heavily influenced by the theories of American economist Milton Friedman Had Joseph become Conservative leader instead of Thatcher which seemed the more likely outcome at the time then something resembling Thatcherism might have emerged as the prevailing economic philosophy of the age But it would not have been the same It took Thatcher s own background and personality her belief in traditional family values and strong defence her suspicion of an overmighty Europe and instinctive affinity with the US to give shape and meaning to what we now know as Thatcherism Taking her cue from Friedman she advocated monetarism controlling the money supply with high interest rates to tame inflation without resorting to union negotiated pay policies Her battle against inflation led to mass unemployment but despite that she managed to win a second general election Low taxation was a key area where Thatcherism was applied Under the previous Labour government there had been high levels of income tax for high earners but Thatcher progressively cut income tax the basic rate of tax fell to 25 while the higher rate was slashed from 83 to 40 There was a shift away from direct taxation to indirect for example by increasing VAT from 8 to 15 Thatcherism also focused on rolling back the frontiers of the state To that end Thatcher introduced privatisation of state owned industries including British Telecom British Gas British Airways and electricity companies putting them back into private hands Such a retreat of the public sector from large areas of the industrial landscape would have seemed unthinkable a few years before but were pushed through Since Thatcher s day such privatisation has gone further says Thatcher expert Professor Richard Toye of the University of Exeter citing the privatisation of British Rail under her successor John Major There was also a huge sale to tenants of council housing The government also abandoned its commitment to full employment stating this was the responsibility of employers and employees Thatcherism is also associated with the Iron Lady s own personal style says Prof Toye She saw herself as a conviction politician She prided herself on her what she would call steadfastness and what others would call her inflexibility She inherited a party that contained supporters of her predecessor Ted Heath labelled by her as wets who opposed her monetarist policies and cuts to public spending In the early stages she had to continue to include them in the cabinet says Prof Toye but then gradually she rid herself of them It was not clear in 1975 what a Thatcher government would mean for Britain And it was clear when she came to power that she couldn t move too far too fast That was reflected by her moving with caution and carefully at first in her first term Although Thatcherism was based on the austere sounding philosophy of monetarism Thatcher wanted to put a human face on it so she talked about running the country s finances like a thrifty housewife She also made much of her personal story It was a fundamental part of her image emphasising the value of hard work her background as a grocer s daughter says Prof Toye She contrasted that with the union leaders who she believed were trying to block economic progress She believed that Victorian family values were the way to improve society through people bettering themselves This was not just through economic means but there was an element of it being linked to respectability and societal values Prof Toye says Conventional marriage and a nuclear family were the building blocks he says One example of her impact on society was the inclusion of Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988 The controversial clause stated that a local authority shall not promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship Because it did not create a criminal offence no prosecution was ever brought under this provision While the legacy of many Thatcher policies remain to this day Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron wants to legalise gay marriage a stance inconceivable to Baroness Thatcher and a huge change says Prof Toye", "Margaret Thatcher was prime minister from 1979 to 1990 and is often credited with overseeing a period of great change in Britain from privatising nationalised industries to allowing council tenants to buy their homes and reining in the power of the unions Here some experts and those who were there at the time reflect on the impact she had Margaret Thatcher s demolition job on the industrial might of the British trade union movement helped to generate an economic revolution In the late 1970s millions of days a year were being lost through strike action but at the end of her premiership stoppages were a fraction of what they had once been Slowly but surely the unions strike weapon was emasculated Strike ballots were required by law walkouts were no longer possible on a show of hands in a car park flying pickets and secondary action had been outlawed and most importantly of all a union s assets were at risk if there was unlawful action as the NUM president Arthur Scargill discovered to his cost in the 1984 85 pit dispute Mr Scargill like other union leaders of his era had grown used under the previous Labour governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan to employers giving way But Mrs Thatcher backed by a largely supportive national press was able to prove that the disputes of the 1980s would be won or lost not just on the picket line but also on the back of public opinion and much of the media s coverage was turned against the unions The 1986 Big Bang and the deregulation of financial markets in the City of London only served to underline the demise of the trade unions The end of nationalisation and the take up of shares by workers in the newly privatised industries was a stark reminder of the shift that had taken place Share ownership trebled in the Thatcher decade and so did the growth in home ownership after the sale of council houses By the late 1980s the all out strike was history no union could ask its heavily mortgaged members to contemplate anything more than a one or perhaps two day strike Organisationally the killer blow for the unions was the end of the closed shop and withdrawal of check off agreements that required employers to deduct union contributions Today union membership is half what it was in 1979 when Mrs Thatcher became prime minister the TUC s affiliated membership stood at just over 12 million the highest it had ever been I was in charge of privatisation policy between 1982 and 1986 and oversaw 22 of the big privatisations that took place It was a really exciting time when we were breaking new ground We latched on to the programme of popular capitalism and saw there was a close relationship between the sale of council homes personal equity plans and employee shareholding Margaret Thatcher had an evangelical zeal to involve ordinary people in ownership and she took no prisoners At the time I serviced the cabinet committee which was in charge of monitoring the progress of the privatisation programme We drew monthly progress charts on what each department was doing and she would tear to pieces anyone who was not keeping up I remember one Number 10 policy adviser saying to me that she was not so much the captain of the ship but the coachman behind a bunch of unruly horses and the only way to make them perform was to put nails in the whips It was a very driven policy In the civil service the brightest and the best brains were working on it There was the old guard resistance at first to the dismantling of big bureaucratic structures But the younger more radical officials thought it was a fantastic thing to do It was amazingly exciting work for people a strange mixture of social engineering and macro economic policy and it was a topic in which Britain led the world At the beginning we were doing the easy ones the companies that would fit more normally into the private sector like British Airways British Telecom and Jaguar It was very hard to argue that those companies should be in the public sector It is easy to forget what size the public commercial sector was it was 15 of GDP Britain was a very very socialist country After she left you had various people trying to reignite the evangelical zeal but the privatisations they then had to look at were less straightforward like the railways and it s easy with hindsight to let some of these taint the privatisations that happened before Deregulation of the stock market the so called Big Bang had to happen It was a response to the needs of global business and finance It did the UK economy a huge service for over 20 years and the benefits have been huge In the 1980s luckily we had a government who understood how the financial world was changing and took steps from the outset to make sure that London caught up and in time overtook other competitors like New York The Big Bang happened on one day in October 1986 and the result was lots of mergers and hitherto fragmented parts of the City starting to come together stock brokers money brokers and banks It was the start of the creation of financial conglomerates In purely GDP terms it was hugely beneficial and since then London has never been overtaken as a financial centre Global businesses came to London creating jobs and the City provided finance to Britain and around the world The impact on growth and the level of economic activity was a tremendously positive step London was a leading financial centre and it was a very necessary step to make sure that leadership was sustained Enormous financial behemoths were created but I don t think it was understood exactly how to regulate them and that continues to be the challenge Regulation in the City and the financial markets pre Big Bang was a gentlemen s club There was a feeling that everyone knew everyone and self regulation could work although disasters did still happen then but on a smaller scale After Big Bang institutions were much larger and more complex financial instruments were created not because of it but because of the way in which financial products were developing It is fair to say that regulators did not keep up with this Generally regulators have struggled to come up with a system that maintains competitiveness while maintaining sufficient surveillance The right of council tenants to buy the homes they lived in was emblematic of Thatcher s government as it encouraged people to operate outside the welfare state It was very much public bad private good very characteristic of her approach But it chimed incredibly well with the aspirations of people at the time to be owner occupiers which had been growing throughout the 1970s That is why Labour was right to adopt it as a policy in the mid 1980s and it remains valid today It was great for those who benefited from it The problem was that the Thatcher government did not care about those who lost out as a result of it and did not do enough to replenish the housing stock that had been sold off This coupled with a shift in policy towards treating council housing as an emergency option rather than homes for ordinary working families meant the housing stock had fallen into a shocking condition by the mid 1990s Labour s priority when it came to power in 1997 was to address a 19bn backlog in repairs The other problem was that the houses in the best condition tended to be the ones that were sold off There was a serious problem in the late 1990s with abandonment I had to demolish relatively newly built estates in northern towns because they were standing empty and had fallen into disrepair Housing was not a priority for Tony Blair compared to health and education A lot of social housing was built during the Blair and Brown years and criticism that more council houses should have been built misses the point The situation could have been far worse if Conservative peers in the House of Lords had not fiercely resisted Thatcher s plans to extend the right to buy to housing association properties in the 1990s She had very clear views about what she wanted to do but she was also a very practical woman She was a supporter of the NHS and she was also very cautious about it She was concerned about the political impact of engaging in major changes in the health service When she became prime minister she certainly had policy priorities and on public services she dealt with education policy first because it was her comfort zone She was a former education secretary But Margaret Thatcher was the prime minister that did facilitate the fundamental change in the way we think about the NHS and the management of the health service The 1990 reforms which gave family doctors the power to take control of their own budgets and to buy care under the GP fundholding scheme are called the Ken Clarke reforms but she was absolutely involved as she was in every area of government The thing I say about the Andrew Lansley Act the coalition s recent NHS reforms is that it is actually based on the same principle of commissioning as the 1990 reforms and the Thatcher government was the government that first passed this piece of legislation The acid test of any policy change is whether it is reversed The policy has not been reversed It has been pursued by practically every health secretary since 1990 with the exception of Frank Dobson The Major years certainly served to allow these reforms to bed in Margaret Thatcher s governments set off a series of changes that have been followed through by successive administrations and changes that can be traced back to the Thatcher years In education Ken Baker introduced grant maintained schools and city technical colleges the precursor of academies introduced by Labour and extended by Michael Gove Mrs Thatcher was an ideologically driven leader That s not to say she wasn t pragmatic as well but for her it was all about the ideology If you think about what that means then she was always going to focus on maximising profit and minimising cost It was inevitable in Britain in the 1980s that maximising profits meant looking towards the emerging markets like banking and financial services the repercussions of which we can still see today Minimising spending meant reducing the cost of the industries that cost the most money mining and manufacturing which were concentrated in the north and in Wales If you push this ideology to its logical outcome then the north was losing out and the south was gaining That s not to say that she deliberately declared war on the north she was just looking to create a profitable economy and a more powerful country But the result was the closing of industries in areas that were then not replaced by anything In former mining towns and villages in Yorkshire Newcastle Durham Wales and Scotland communities have died There isn t really any employment The service industries that grew up since the 1980s have not reached them You had generation after generation going into work in the old industries but now you have generation after generation living in poverty There is no doubt that inequality grew and poverty increased under Thatcher Her response to that I guess would be it s all about the individual You have to go out there and make things happen if you want them That sounds very good on paper but for some people that simply didn t materialise New Labour did not abandon the fundamental elements of Thatcherism particularly economic Thatcherism They tried to deal with its negative impact in a more socially democratic way introducing working tax credits and the minimum wage but the fundamental elements were never abandoned They tried to mitigate some of the harshness but it is very difficult to deal with Unless you go back to directing industry into certain areas it s very difficult to create employment where the economy has moved out", "Ben Cooper says the decision is a compromise but not a fudge The BBC has defended its decision not to play in full on Radio 1 s Official Chart Show a song at the centre of an anti Baroness Thatcher campaign A five second clip of Ding Dong The Witch is Dead will be played in a news item on Sunday s show BBC Radio 1 controller Ben Cooper said the move over the Wizard of Oz film track had been a difficult compromise He said he had to balance respect for someone who had just died with issues around freedom of speech Sales of the song from the 1939 musical starring Judy Garland have soared since former Prime Minister Lady Thatcher s death on Monday aged 87 Speaking to BBC News Mr Cooper said You have a track which I believe is disrespectful It is not a political track it is a personal attack on an individual who has just died But on the other hand if I ban the track then you have arguments about censorship and freedom of speech I also took into account the very difficult scenario of the fact there s a grieving family involved here who have yet to bury a loved one We should respect the dead I think it s absolutely atrocious So those sort of elements were in my thinking to come up with this decision that I would play not the track in full but a clip of the track within a journalistic environment The single is set to take the number three spot in Sunday s countdown according to the Official Charts Company Meanwhile a serving police officer who posted offensive messages on Twitter following Lady Thatcher s death has resigned Sgt Jeremy Scott of the Metropolitan Police is reported to have written that he hoped her death was painful and degrading Scotland Yard said Sgt Scott s resignation was accepted with immediate effect The Met s Commander Allan Gibson added This officer s behaviour was completely unacceptable and it is right that he has resigned In his BBC blog Mr Cooper explained that as controller of Radio 1 there were times when you find yourself caught between a rock and a hard place And the corporation released a statement saying The BBC finds this campaign distasteful but does not believe the record should be banned On Sunday the Radio 1 Chart Show will contain a news item explaining why the song is in the charts during which a short clip will be played as it has been in some of our news programmes BBC director general Tony Hall said I understand the concerns about this campaign I personally believe it is distasteful and inappropriate However I do believe it would be wrong to ban the song outright as free speech is an important principle and a ban would only give it more publicity The original song was performed in the Wizard of Oz by characters celebrating the demise of a much hated witch Rival campaigns are under way to get a song considered to be more favourable to Lady Thatcher into this week s countdown as well Capital FM which has its own chart show said the station was currently reviewing the situation The Conservative chairman of the Commons culture media and sport select committee John Whittingdale said the BBC s decision was a sensible compromise Jarvis Cocker It s a free speech issue I don t think it would have been right to have allowed the Chart Show to have been hijacked for political purposes and had they played the whole song that would have been the consequence he said But on the other hand they couldn t have just ignored the fact that it does feature amongst the most downloaded singles of the week However the Conservative MP for Reading East Rob Wilson said the track should be played in its entirety He said I think that Margaret Thatcher would be horrified having helped free millions of people in eastern Europe and been the symbol of freedom around the world that she could in any way have censorship in her own country The BBC has had a very difficult decision and it s come up with a very British old fashioned fudge Singer Jarvis Cocker told the BBC that Lady Thatcher may not have minded the controversy Mr Cocker who has a show on BBC Radio 6 Music said This is a premier who seemed to thrive on conflict and stuff like that You can t have somebody who s so divisive in the country pass away and there be no negative reaction to it DJ Paul Gambaccini said Sunday s show had become part of the BBC history of censorship In another development Hillsborough campaigner Margaret Aspinall urged people attending a party to mark Lady

conference is being held in Castlebar County Mayo During his speech Mr Adams also talked about government failure in the republic of Ireland Over the last five years Fine Gael Labour and Fianna F il have taken 28 billion euro out of the economy in taxes and cuts Cuts to hospitals to schools to garda stations taxes on pensions on savings and on homes Mr Adams also spoke about progress in Northern Ireland and the continuation of dialogue with unionists and loyalists There is an imperative on republicans challenging though it may be to build alliances on social and economic issues with working class loyalists and unionists he said The Protestant Unionist and Loyalist people are not going away And Sinn F in doesn t want them to go away Mr Adams said both sides had to get to know each other better I commit our party without preconditions to be part of such discussions as we face into the Orange marching season and to find solutions to contentious issues and to tackle economic disadvantage This is the only way to build a fair society It is what the vast majority of citizens want The tiny minorities who espouse violence have been rejected he added The Sinn Fein president also said he felt there was a lot of work to be done to ensure that policing is non partisan and civic Recent decisions by the PSNI have failed this test Mr Adams said He also called for a Bill of Rights Earlier the Ard Fheis rejected a call for the party to adopt a freedom of conscience approach to abortion In his address to the party Mr Adams said there was much more work to be done within

for cruelty to badgers has almost doubled in five years new figures suggest The data obtained by Labour MP Diane Abbott showed 58 people were prosecuted in magistrates courts under the Protection of Badgers Act in 2011 up from 30 in 2007 Ms Abbott said pro cull campaigning had given a green light to those carrying out crimes such as badger baiting The government said unlicensed killing of badgers was unacceptable Two trial badger culls aimed at tackling the spread of tuberculosis TB in cattle are set to go ahead later this year in Gloucestershire and Somerset They had been postponed late in 2012 amid fears they could not be carried out effectively but were approved in February after final licence conditions were met A reserve pilot will also be prepared in Dorset If anyone has any evidence of that occurring they are strongly encouraged to report this to local wildlife crime police officers to deal with The figures revealed by Ms Abbott in a parliamentary question showed that prosecutions for crimes including badger baiting have risen each year since 2007 with only a minor dip to 48 in 2010 from 50 in 2009 Speaking in Parliament Ms Abbott said the rise was alarming stressing she believed this kind of cruelty is barbaric We ve got to send the message out that this kind of thing is wrong The laws are clear so we need to talk about why these incidents are increasing she said The Labour MP added she was concerned that there are gangs of people sometimes with dogs who think this is a macho thing to do The problem is that some of campaigning on badger culling has given a green light to this kind attitude to our wildlife Labour has opposed a badger cull arguing it will cost more money than it saves put strain on the police and could even spread TB as badgers flee to different parts of the country Responding to the figures a spokesman for the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs said Any killing of badgers without a licence is illegal and unacceptable If anyone has any evidence of that occurring they are strongly encouraged to report this to local wildlife crime police officers to deal with The government has previously said the cull of badgers is necessary as part of a science led programme to tackle TB which has been devastating to farmers", "A written plea by farmers leaders for cash help for farmers who lost livestock in the heavy snow has been rejected by the Welsh government Unions said ministers had closed the door to emergency aid being offered to farmers in other parts of the UK Some farmers in upland areas of north and mid Wales are still trying to find animals buried by the blizzards The minister responsible Alun Davies responded by reiterating his sympathy but again rejected the appeal for cash Welsh Government appears to have closed the door on emergency aid even before knowing the full extent of the losses Earlier this week the Natural Resources and Food Minister extended the relaxation of rules on burying fallen livestock on farmland for a second week in a bid to assist the industry but rejected calls for compensation However the leaders of four groups representing farmers in Wales published an open letter on Friday urging Mr Davies to change his mind The letter was signed by leaders of the two main unions NFU Cymru and the FUW the president of Wales YFC Young Farmers Clubs and the chairman of the Country Land and Business Association CLA in Wales They said they recognised that a devolved government in Wales has been generally good for the farming industry and that it also receives substantial aid under EU funding But they continued In Wales Welsh Government appears to have closed the door on emergency aid even before knowing the full extent of the losses which continue to mount on some farms as the snow recedes the Welsh Government argument being that there are fundamental differences to the losses sustained in Wales relative to other parts of the UK From our perspectives the losses that have been sustained on some farms in Wales are no different to those in Scotland Northern Ireland or England and are such in some instances to threaten business viability There is a real matter of fairness and affordability here The letter said that for some farmers it has been a harrowing experience that has left some drained not just financially but emotionally too It added These farmers need evidence that Welsh government cares about their plight They are not seeking to be advantaged as a result of the exceptional circumstances they have had to endure but they do look to Welsh Government to provide parity of treatment with others suffering similar consequences in other parts of the UK Mr Davies published a letter in response expressing his sympathy and the willingness of the Welsh government to consider any practical suggestions farmers leaders may have to alleviate the situation But he repeated his decision to reject the idea of emergency aid You as the industry s leaders must also understand that many other parts of the economy within Wales and indeed other parts of agriculture have suffered from the effects of the weather over the last 12 months and more generally in the global downturn of recent years he wrote There is a real matter of fairness and affordability here It is also hard to see how repeated demands for short term subsidies support the process of change necessary for farming businesses to meet the increasing challenges of the global marketplace We need solutions for Welsh agriculture that are sustainable in every sense", "At the end of 2013 Bulgarians and Romanians will gain the same rights to work in the UK as other EU citizens The UK government is considering limiting their access to benefits healthcare and housing Here is a guide to the issues What s happening Bulgarians and Romanians gained the right to visa free travel to the UK in 2007 when their countries joined the EU But there were temporary restrictions on the kind of jobs they could take Employers had to apply for work permits and migrants for an accession worker card Low skilled workers were restricted to existing quota schemes in the agricultural and food processing sectors These restrictions will be dropped on 1 January Bulgarians and Romanians will also be entitled to claim the same benefits and NHS care as other EU citizens What is the government worried about Public concern over immigration is running high and ministers want to demonstrate to critics such as the anti EU party UKIP that Britain is not a soft touch or beholden to Brussels At the same time they do not want to deter skilled migrants who can help the economy David Cameron says he wants to make sure people come to the UK for the right reasons not just to claim benefits Which other countries have imposed restrictions Apart from Britain eight countries have imposed restrictions of some kind on Romanians and Bulgarians which will expire at the same time How many Romanians and Bulgarians do ministers think will move to the UK The coalition is not making any official predictions Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has said he has no confidence in figures published on his department s own website predicting that about 13 000 will arrive He knows that Labour got its fingers burned when it grossly underestimated the number of migrants expected to come from Eastern Europe in 2003 when Poland and other former Soviet bloc countries joined the EU Pressure group Migration Watch has predicted 50 000 could come to the UK every year until 2019 Will it be the same as when Poland and other Eastern European countries joined the EU The government insists the situation is very different this time as eight other EU countries will lift labour market restrictions at the same time In 2003 only the UK Ireland and Sweden opened their doors to Eastern European workers Many Bulgarians and Romanians have already come to work in the UK since 2007 under various schemes So how many Romanians and Bulgarians are living in the UK at the moment According to the Office for National Statistics in July 2012 there were 94 000 people who were born in Romania and 47 000 people who were born in Bulgaria resident in the UK What benefits can European nationals currently claim People coming to the UK from the European Economic Area the EU member states and Iceland Liechtenstein and Norway do not have unrestricted access to UK social security benefits and tax credits Most will have to pass the habitual residence test before they can claim To pass you must have a right to reside in the UK which means you are economically active or are able to support yourself and you must be intending to settle here for the time being in other words be habitually resident The test applies to British citizens returning to the UK after time abroad as well as people coming to the UK from other countries If you pass the test you can claim housing benefit council tax benefit access to local authority housing income support jobseeker s allowance and employment and support allowance How will the government make claiming benefits harder The government says it is particularly concerned about the pressure created by migrants on local services housing and the health service To tackle this the prime minister says he wants migrants to have to prove they are genuinely seeking employment to claim jobless benefits This would be a tougher test than the current one and would include a requirement for jobseekers to speak English Immigrants may also be kept off council house waiting lists in England for at least two years under plans for councils to introduce a residency test Mr Cameron says he wants the UK to get better at charging foreign governments for NHS treatment provided to non working overseas nationals Ministers are also examining the possibility of linking some benefits to contributions which could exclude new

most are hard working and want to contribute to British society They also insist that most Bulgarians and Romanians who want to be in the UK are already in the country and the predicted flood on 1 January will not happen Most Romanians would prefer to live in Spain or Italy where they find it easier to learn the language embassy officials say Why are those two countries being singled out for

saying he feels lucky to be alive Speaking on his own programme BBC Two s Andrew Marr Show he said he had been heavily overworking in the year before the stroke which was sparked by an intensive rowing machine session The 53 year old presenter who fell ill in January said he was doing a lot of physio to help with his walking He added he would be returning to work Appearing in a pre recorded interview on Sunday s programme the journalist and television presenter took part in a discussion on the legacy of Margaret Thatcher before talking about his illness He told guest presenter Sophie Raworth I had a major stroke I m frankly lucky to be alive I had been heavily overworking mostly my own fault in the year before that I d had two minor strokes it turned out in that year which I hadn t noticed Marr explained he had fallen into the terrible trap of believing what he read in newspapers which encouraged people to take very intensive exercise in short bursts and that s the way to health He went on I went onto a rowing machine and gave it everything I had and had a strange feeling afterwards a blinding headache and flashes of light served out the family meal went to bed woke up the next morning lying on the floor unable to move Beware rowing machines or at least beware being too enthusiastic on rowing machines would be my message to the nation he said Marr said the stroke had not impaired his voice or memory but had affected the whole left hand side of my body which is why I m still not able to walk fluently I do a kind of elegant hobble is the best I can manage my left arm isn t much good yet and I ve got a lot of physio still to do he said However the presenter added that after concentrating on a period of intensive physio he planned to return to work I m certainly coming back I ve got a lot more to say about it all but I m going to wait until I ve gone through the physio to do so Born in Glasgow Marr began his career in journalism on the Scotsman newspaper in 1981 later moving to London to become its political correspondent He was part of the team which launched the Independent in 1986 later becoming its editor He joined the BBC as political editor in May 2000 Marr has also presented a number of history programmes along with his politics show and has had five books published He is married to journalist Jackie Ashley and has three children

take on a public sector debt burden at just over half of the rate faced by the whole UK The SNP administration has estimated the share of the UK s debt if it was allocated based on population It contrasts this with what it claims is the different position if Scotland is credited with revenue from oil and gas over the past 30 years The UK Treasury said the analysis was based on favourable assumptions Scotland s share of the UK s debt would be a part of any negotiations following a Yes vote in the independence in September 2014 A new volley of statistics has been fired during the past week by the Scottish government To what end Well the political intention is clear to kill off the notion that Scotland is incapable of paying its way That used to be an argument often made against Scottish independence often helped by citing in isolation the higher spending per head on Scottish public services It s only heard these days from those who have failed to keep up with the debate The SNP s latest publication Scotland s Balance Sheet provides campaigning ammunition pointing to Scots paying more in tax and spending less as a share of the economy as a whole on services such as pensions and welfare The UK faced public sector debt in 2011 12 of 1 100bn 72 of Gross Domestic Product GDP the main measure of an economy s output Ministers at Holyrood said that a share out of that debt to an independent Scotland on the basis of its population share would come to 92bn Because Scotland has a higher GDP per head if oil and gas is included that equates to 62 of national output Scottish GDP including oil and gas from Scottish waters came to 150 8bn in 2011 12 When Scotland is calculated to have its population share including offshore oil and gas it comes to 127 2bn But the SNP s other reckoning is that Scotland should have to pay less debt because oil and gas from under Scottish waters has contributed more in tax over the past 30 years On that basis it says Scotland should only have to take on 56bn which was 38 of GDP in 2011 12 That would take Scotland s debt levels to around those the UK had before the credit crunch The latest reckoning of Scotland s financial position is part of a report published called Scotland s Balance Sheet Parts of it were released earlier this week In these the Scottish government argued pension and welfare costs would be a smaller share of the Scottish economy than for the UK as a whole and most of western Europe A second portion of the report highlighted figures showing tax receipts per head have been higher than those of the UK for the past 30 years That offshore asset is calculated to give Scotland a GDP per head higher than the UK Scotland benefits from spending that is consistently 10 higher per person than the UK average Tax on oil and gas production would also have given an independent Scotland a higher tax take per head over the three decades Without offshore oil and gas Scotland s GDP is in a similar position to that of the UK as a whole and its share of taxes paid to the UK Treasury is thought to be slightly lower than that share of Scotland s population Nicola Sturgeon the deputy first minister said The mismanagement of the UK economy by Westminster has led to a situation where we are all burdened with a massive UK debt That is an argument for independence not against it Scotland s share of the UK s public sector debt will obviously be a crucial part of the negotiations following a vote for independence and this analysis shows that Scotland will be in a strong position in these negotiations The minister added It is clear that whatever way we look at it Scotland is in a much better financial position than the UK including on the issue of national debt Both of the methodologies show that Scotland s estimated share of national debt takes up a smaller proportion of our economy than is the case for the UK which means that in all circumstances Scotland will be better off with independence A spokesman for the UK Treasury said This is a partial analysis based on favourable assumptions and data from a year when North Sea receipts were particularly high Scotland benefits from spending that is consistently 10 higher per person than the UK average The independent IFS have explained that Scotland would face a much tougher fiscal challenge over the long term than the rest of the UK The Scottish government s own internal analysis acknowledges that North Sea receipts will fall dramatically over the coming decades This report doesn t explain how an independent Scotland would fill the black hole it will leave in its finances", "Well known hymns and poems will mark Baroness Thatcher s funeral on Wednesday Downing Street says Details of the ceremony have been published including the hymns To Be A Pilgrim I Vow to Thee My Country and Love Divine All Loves Excelling The programme features lines from Wordsworth s Intimations of Immortality and TS Eliot s Little Gidding Meanwhile the Bishop of Grantham where Lady Thatcher was born called the scale of the event a mistake Speaking to BBC Lincolnshire the Rt Rev Dr Tim Ellis said the ceremonial funeral was asking for trouble and should be more low key and personal because people would use the event for their own political agenda In other developments Lady Thatcher who died at the age of 87 on 8 April has been awarded a ceremonial funeral with military honours one step down from a state funeral It has been reported she herself insisted she did not want her body to lie in state

Clement Danes the Central Church of the Royal Air Force on the Strand It will then be transferred to a gun carriage drawn by the King s Troop Royal Artillery and taken in procession from St Clement Danes to St Paul s Cathedral The route will be lined by military personnel from all three services The BBC s Nicholas Witchell talks through the funeral procession route Fourteen Chelsea Pensioners

Lady Thatcher s funeral will bear the unmistakeable imprint of her personality The music to be played at the start and end of the service is by a conspicuously British only group of composers and the last hymn will be the patriotic I Vow To Thee My Country Lady Thatcher s Methodist upbringing at the Wesleyan Chapel in which her father was a lay preacher will be commemorated by Charles Wesley s hymn Love Divine All Loves Excelling Lady Thatcher often cited Christianity to justify her ideas about the market economy and capitalism and the importance of choice For her Christianity was about personal redemption rather than social reform calling for hard work and personal responsibility although it was questioned by some in the Church for whom it was a partial view Lady Thatcher s was a life long faith one which her funeral will richly commemorate Senior politicians and foreign heads of state will take their seats under the dome of St Paul s before members of the Thatcher family followed by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are escorted from the Great West Door In front of the coffin Lady Thatcher s grandchildren Michael and Amanda Thatcher will lay cushions bearing the insignia of two orders she was appointed to the Order of the Garter and the Order of Merit on the Dome Altar Amanda Thatcher and Prime Minister David Cameron will deliver two readings from the King

Purcell Gustav Holst John Ireland Herbert Howells Edward Elgar Frank Bridge Charles Stanford Hubert Parry and Ralph Vaughan Williams as well as Johannes Brahms Gabriel Faure and Johann Sebastian Bach The Bishop of London Richard Chartres will preach and the blessing will be given by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby The invitation only funeral will be followed by a private cremation Lady Thatcher s family have asked well wishers to consider making a donation to the Royal Hospital Chelsea rather than giving flowers Downing Street says Lady Thatcher s estate has offered to make a

week and is set to do so for several days to come But it s a very different media world from the one she inherited on entering Downing Street and not just because of the internet Twitter and Facebook When Margaret Thatcher became Britain s first woman prime minister in May 1979 The Times didn t report the fact It had stopped publication because of an industrial dispute which closed it for 11 months So had its sister paper the Sunday Times Within three months ITV was also on strike blacking out all television advertising in the UK for 11 weeks Those lengthy shutdowns are a reminder of just how different life was in 1979 and how the media business was transformed by her time in office In 1979 as in many areas of industry leaders of the printing broadcasting and telecoms unions ruled the roost as Rupert Murdoch recalled in a personal tribute to Margaret Thatcher in The Times this week We were stuck with an industry that refused to change its ways he wrote There were constant threats to go slow to stop the presses or to walk out altogether It couldn t go on The restrictive practices inflated the pay of union members both in newspapers and broadcasting reduced company profits and protected over manning in the face of new technology already commonplace in other countries In 1982 there were only three television channels and the country was in the grip of a deep recession with Margaret Thatcher in power Then along came Channel 4 British newspapers were printed only in black and white colour was confined to the supplements and the number of pages and sections was severely limited But it wasn t only the unions that imposed restrictions Copyright on TV listings meant newspapers couldn t print the next day s programme schedules let alone the next week s Viewers had to buy both Radio Times for BBC programmes and TV Times for ITV to find out what would be on protecting the broadcasters lucrative publishing duopoly And under Government control of the airwaves ITV was the only television channel allowed to show commercials which it sold through 15 regional monopolies Only in London could advertisers negotiate with rival companies Thames and London Weekend Television But the seeds of the transformation had already been sown Margaret Thatcher was elected with a public mandate to tame the unions following Labour s Winter of Discontent in 1978 9 which left bodies unburied and mountains of uncollected rubbish She introduced industrial relations legislation which outlawed closed shops secondary picketing and made secret ballots compulsory instead of mass show of hands voting Taking advantage of the new laws Murdoch decided to break the unions power secretly moving his four national newspapers to a new plant in Wapping east London which used the new computerised technology Mrs Thatcher had strengthened Murdoch s hand by letting him take over The Times and the Sunday Times even though he already owned the Sun and the News of the World The previous owners the Thomson Organisation had decided to sell after the 11 month closure The last straw was when their journalists who had received full pay throughout the dispute voted to go on strike themselves The Times had made losses for many years but the Sunday Times with a large circulation and packed with advertising was assumed to be very profitable To many people s surprise the Thatcher government permitted the takeover without referring it to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission The former editor of the Sunday Times Sir Harold Evans wrote A newspaper merger unprecedented in history went through in three days The decision was formally taken by the Secretary of State for Trade John Biffen on the grounds that the two papers were not going concerns and could close if the takeover were delayed by an MMC investigation The ruling was hotly criticised in parliament and the press In his book Good Times Bad Times Sir Harold reported that Mrs Thatcher was the architect of the deal Normally the apostle of competition on this occasion the lady was ready for turning the U turn she executed was in the expectation that Murdoch s affinity with her politics would impel him to ensure favourable coverage For many years it was denied not least in the official history of The Times that the two had met in the run up to the bid being cleared But in 2012 it emerged from papers released under the 30 year rule that Murdoch had had a secret lunch with Mrs Thatcher at Chequers to put his plans to her Evans wrote that the meeting that never took place was highly improper Mrs Thatcher s press spokesman Bernard Ingham in a note of the meeting claimed that she did nothing more than wish him well in his bid and noted the need to improve Fleet Street staffing levels and to introduce new technology With four national newspapers two daily two Sunday quality as well as popular Murdoch was now in a stronger position to take on the unions at Wapping In January 1986 he made his move The resulting dispute which led to violent battles between police and pickets lasted months reinforcing the media mogul s reputation as a hate figure among the left Eventually Murdoch won not merely increasing his papers profitability but helping his rivals to introduce the new technology as well as new entrants to the market such as the Independent Andrew Neil then the editor of the Sunday Times said on Radio 4 s The Media Show this week that Thatcher played a crucial role in the publisher s victory and not just by outlawing secondary picketing He said Rupert Murdoch had told him that he had squared Mrs Thatcher as far as the police were concerned that he d had a guarantee from her that enough police would be made available to keep the company going about its lawful business He went on I remember it well because he compared it with New York he had not attempted this with the New York Post because he didn t think the mayor could deliver on that and he didn t think he could count on the police if he tried to do the same there The Thatcher government was also trying to shake up broadcasting After numerous rows with the BBC over issues such as the coverage of the Falklands Conflict in 1982 the Real Lives documentary on Northern Ireland terrorism and the bombing of Libya in 1986 Mrs Thatcher hoped to cut the corporation down to size She set up the Peacock Committee to examine whether the BBC could be funded by advertising so the licence fee could be scrapped Ideologically she was very opposed to the BBC perceiving it to be very left wing said Professor Patrick Barwise of the London Business School who was advising the corporation at the time On The Media Show he said It took us a very short time to persuade the committee it wasn t a runner If you d had advertising on the BBC the revenue would have come from ITV and you d have had less money for programmes Meanwhile a new BBC director general John Birt was making radical changes at the corporation which were highly unpopular with its staff His supporters say that stopped the Thatcher government breaking up the BBC and selling off stations like Radio 1 Instead she turned her attention to ITV In 1987 at a Downing Street summit Mrs Thatcher told ITV bosses that their industry was the last bastion of restrictive practices In her memoirs The Downing Street Years she wrote Broadcasting was one of a number of areas in which special pleading by powerful interest groups was disguised as high minded commitment to some greater good Attempts to break the powerful duopoly which the BBC and ITV had achieved which encouraged restrictive practices increased costs and kept out talent were decried as threatening the quality of broadcasting The first shake up came with the launch of Channel 4 in November 1982 An earlier government report had concluded that the younger generation of producers is bubbling over with ideas which are not allowed to surface and the Thatcher government decreed that most of its programmes should be provided by a new breed of independent producers Phil Redmond creator of Brookside was one of them On its 30th anniversary he wrote In 1982 there were only three television channels and the country was in the grip of a deep recession with Margaret Thatcher in power Then along came Channel 4 It made a huge immediate impact as it was given the remit to cater for minorities and find voices that were unheard and it certainly lived up to that It allowed new people to be seen on TV with new ideas and voices But the biggest shake up in commercial television came from the decision to award ITV licences to the highest bidder subject to a quality hurdle It was highly controversial One of ITV s most successful programme making companies Thames Television was outbid by Carlton Television led by Michael Green He had earlier tried to buy Thames but been prevented from doing so by the regulator the Independent Broadcasting Authority as he described on The Media Show The licence process had an unexpected and unwelcome outcome for Mrs Thatcher The man often described as her favourite TV executive Bruce Gyngell had turned the ailing breakfast station TV am into profit and kept it on the air during a union dispute in 1987 helping transform working practices in the industry But TV am was beaten by an unrealistically high bid from GMTV Mr Gyngell later received a letter from the prime minister which caused a sensation when he read it out at an awards lunch When I see how some of the other licences have been awarded she wrote I am mystified that you did not receive yours and heartbroken I am only too painfully aware that I was responsible for the legislation", "There s been much debate about Margaret Thatcher s political legacy in the days since her death I have little doubt she is the most significant UK politician of my lifetime And she has certainly never been forgotten in the north east of England where I ply my trade So when I first began compiling the elements of her obituary it wasn t hard to find people with strong opinions When I came to look at our archive pictures I was also struck by how much of what s become legendary about the Thatcher years played out in the region Our group of miners wives was in the House of Commons when she called us the enemy within and that ll stay with me forever Of course there was the miners strike though the North East was just one of the battlegrounds in that dispute There were also other major industrial closures and job losses in the shipyards and steel industry But there was also the walk in the wilderness in Teesside To her detractors this was her revelling in the industrial wasteland produced by her policies To her it was a symbol of necessary change clearing the way for a brighter future There was also the footage where she described critics as moaning minnies while on a visit to the North East in 1985 In fact there was an astonishing edge to almost every encounter I saw her have here It s hard to see the same footage ever being produced in these days of media management and focus groups Of course there are plenty of people in the North East who detest Margaret Thatcher to this day There are many anecdotes about people having champagne on ice in anticipation of her death But a study of the politics of the day actually suggests far more people voted for her brand of Conservatism than for David Cameron s In 1983 her party took 34 of North East votes In 2010 David Cameron won less than 24 After the 1983 election the party had MPs in Darlington Stockton Langbaurgh Tynemouth and even in Newcastle Now they have just two in the region and they don t have a single councillor in Newcastle It s possible that the folk memory of Thatcherism has left Conservatism as a toxic brand in the North East but if it did it only really took root after its architect had left office And perhaps local Conservatives still have something to thank her for The wilderness she walked through in 1987 is now a business park in Stockton South the only North East seat the Conservatives gained in 2010 But if you really want an example of Mrs Thatcher s conflicted legacy I d point to two women who I spoke to for her obituary Both of them entered politics because of Margaret Thatcher but for very different reasons Juliana Heron s husband Bob was a miner at Hetton pit in County Durham when the 1984 strike began At the time she had little interest in politics But the strike radicalised her She became one of the band of miners wives sucked into the dispute The strike was lost and the pit closed She said Our group of miners wives was in the House of Commons when she called us the enemy within and that ll stay with me forever I m not a hateful person but I despise what she did to our area People will go through history and they ll wonder what happened to Hetton Basically Margaret Thatcher happened to Hetton she closed the pit and closed the area I was watching what was the winter of discontent and then Margaret Thatcher came on I was only 10 but what she said made sense to me Juliana has since become a Labour councillor in Sunderland even becoming the city s mayor in 2003 and admits that she only entered politics because of the impact of Margaret Thatcher And the same can be said of Anne Marie Trevelyan She stood for the Conservatives in Berwick at the 2010 General Election and will contest the seat again in 2015 She vividly remembers her political awakening beginning when she saw Margaret Thatcher on the news as a child She said I was watching what was the winter of discontent and then Margaret Thatcher came on I was only 10 but what she said made sense to me That sparked something in me which has never gone away and I m putting myself forward for election It built a belief in me that if you don t agree with something you should stand up and fight for it She was my first clear example of that being possible As we approach Baroness Thatcher s funeral people will continue to clash about her legacy While some watch the procession from London on television some ex miners in Easington in County Durham will be holding a party She will not be forgotten any time soon in the region where she had such an impact When I began my journalistic career in 1992 she was no longer Prime Minister but she hasn t stopped being part of political debate in the last two decades and I expect her name to continue to generate strong emotions and opinions well past my retirement", "One of an MP s most important roles is to help make and change the laws

passage of a bill Plans of the House of Commons and House of Lords based on information from www parliament uk", "The details of 100 companies accused of illegally using unpaid interns have been passed to HM Revenue and Customs by business minister Jo Swinson Ms Swinson said the exploitation of interns was a significant problem and unpaid internships attacked the minimum wage The list compiled by campaign group Intern Aware is said to include some big household names The minister said more needed to be done to enforce minimum wage law Unpaid internships have been criticised as barriers to social mobility and because they enable employers to avoid national minimum wage legislation Employers break the law if they employ unpaid interns in roles that are defined under law as work This legal definition includes having set hours being engaged for an extended period of time and being given a defined role rather than just observing Anyone who is working must be paid the national minimum wage for anyone 21 or over it is currently 6 19 an hour Intern Aware which campaigns in favour of paid internships said the list covered a range of employers from small to medium sized business to major companies The list covers sectors that are normally associated with internships such as fashion PR and the media but also more unusual areas like accountancy architecture and retail Some of the companies were advertising for internships that were clearly job functions like administrative internships the group said Luxury London department store Harrods was recently forced to pay an intern 1 800 for work carried out in its marketing department after misclassifying her as a volunteer Ms Swinson told the BBC she had been only too happy to pass the letter on to HMRC adding that it was right that inspectors should investigate it We have national minimum wage laws and they are there for a reason If these are being flouted then that needs to be dealt with she said There is a significant problem in society where people are being exploited for no money when they should be being paid We have got to change attitudes and make sure companies realise it is not appropriate Where there is a job that needs doing then it needs to be treated as a job and not be done be someone who is not being paid This attacks the national minimum wage Across many sectors like fashion and the media this has very much been the generally accepted way of doing things It is a cultural thing and that needs to change We need to make sure we enforce the law and increase awareness of the problem However Ms Swinson stopped short of backing new legislation in the area to make the rules tighter She said HMRC was already making progress in enforcing the law last year bringing in 4m of wages arrears for 26 500 individuals who were either underpaid or paid no wage at all This was up from 3 6m in the previous year She said the government was also looking at ways to name and shame companies which haven t properly complied with the law This is an issue about social mobility as much as anything else It shouldn t be that only those who can afford it should be able to have those opportunities It is not helpful if they are only accessible to the rich she added Following criticism last year the Liberal Democrats changed their internship programme so it now pays the minimum wage although some Lib Dem MPs and MPs from other parties still advertise internships which pay expenses only Intern Aware s co director Ben Lyons said he was pleased Ms Swinson had decided to pass the list of employers on to HMRC He said This is only the start and a lot more needs to be done A spokesman for HMRC said it did not comment on individual investigations", "Here are details of Ed Miliband

establish a bridgehead in county councils across England and Wales at 2 May s local elections its leader Nigel Farage has predicted The anti EU party is aiming to capitalise on public concern over immigration tax rises and wind farms It has traditionally done poorly in local elections but has gained more than 30 councillors through Tory defections in recent months A record 1 734 candidates are standing just 22 fewer than the Lib Dems And with the UKIP riding high in national opinion polls Mr Farage has predicted it will win seats in each of the 34 councils where elections are being held He has spent the past two weeks travelling in an open topped bus addressing packed meetings of supporters At the final tour stop in Tunbridge Wells Kent he told supporters in the town centre UKIP was drawing support from across the political spectrum not just disaffected Tory voters as the media assumed The reason for this he argued is that the three so called main parties were led by out of touch bunch of college kids who had never done a day s work in their lives Mr Farage is keen to maintain the momentum generated by his party s best ever Westminster by election result when it came a close second to the Lib Dems in Eastleigh last month UKIP s local election manifesto concentrates on its flagship policy of ending open door immigration and putting pressure on the government not to lift restrictions on workers from Bulgaria and Romania on 1 January which proved a successful formula in Eastleigh Speaking to the BBC in Tunbridge Wells he said he had a simple message for voters Use 2 May as an opportunity to tell the government and tell the opposition that we don t want the door further extended to Bulgaria and Romania next year Thousands of Bulgarians and Romanians already live and work in the UK under work permit schemes and there is fierce debate over how many more will make the journey when the final restrictions are lifted UKIP argues that youth unemployment is too high and local services under too much strain to accept any more new arrivals at this stage Mr Farage also stressed that UKIP councillors would focus on local issues such as keeping council tax bills down and opposing new wind farms If elected UKIP county councillors would oppose every single wind farm application The party is also committed to cracking down on crime and anti social behaviour getting more police officers on to the street and handing more power to local people through referendums It has also promised to crack down on councillors expenses and limit housing developments on green belt

free to demonstrate But he added that it would be a pity if they chose to do so Hundreds of people took part in a demonstration condemning Lady Thatcher in Trafalgar Square London on Saturday Sixteen

87 and her funeral service will be preceded by a procession from Westminster to St Paul s Dignitaries from around the world will attend with military personnel lining the route Police have prepared for some protests Lord Parkinson who also served as energy secretary and trade secretary in Lady Thatcher s cabinet told the BBC s Andrew Marr Show I don t think it would have upset her When you are as strong a character as she was you don t disapprove of divisions He added One of the joys of being British is that we are free to demonstrate But he said If people feel hostile and want to demonstrate it s a pity Lord Parkinson said he hoped people if they express their disapproval will do it in an agreeable way The Dean of St Paul s Very Reverend Dr David Ison said I hope that people will remember this is about a human being who s facing death He added that Lady Thatcher was not some kind of monster or a witch but was actually a human being doing what she believed to be right and we can respect that even though we may not agree with her politics Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude who is helping to organise the ceremony told Sky News it would be a fitting tribute for a very very great lady He asked protesters to be respectful adding Remember there are hundreds of millions of people around the world who will enjoy the same freedom because of her Westminster St Clement

services hospitals and GP care But if the health service is to thrive in the 21st Century that will have to change There will need to be a third pillar the community service or integrated care as it is known in the NHS The term covers services aimed at people with long term conditions They are the patients who need care as there is no cure Oldham s Musculoskeletal Partnership provides an integrated service for rheumatology and orthopaedic patients It involves GPs hospital consultants physiotherapists podiatrists and occupational therapy The team sees about 10 000 patients a year with conditions such as inflammatory arthritis It has proved so successful that rheumatology services have now been decommissioned from the local hospital while all outpatient orthopaedics work from physiotherapy to pain management is done at the clinic It includes diabetes patients who need their treatment regimes closely monitored and regular foot and eye checks It also covers support and rehabilitation for the frail and vulnerable when they are released from hospital and help for people with dementia to stay independent But the problem with the current system is that they often do not get the help they need or do not get it early enough The result They eventually end up in hospital more ill than they would have been This is bad for the individual and bad for the health service as hospital care is more expensive Jennifer Dixon chief executive of the Nuffield Trust think tank says this is the crux of the issue We have talked about integrated care for so long but I think this time it will be different It has to be because of the money situation We have no choice A quick look at the statistics proves this An estimated 15 million people in England have a long term condition a quarter of the population But they account for 7 out of every 10 spent on the health and care In Grimsby most adult health and social care outside hospital is provided by Care Plus Group a not for profit organisation paid for by the NHS and local authority It provides nearly 50 services covering everything from community nursing to meals on wheels and drugs and alcohol support All can be accessed via a single phone number An example of this is the Hope Specialist Service a community centre staffed by volunteers with support from health workers including physios occupational therapists and specialist nurses It offers help for people after falls and those with lung disease so they can recover their confidence independence and find friends It has proved successful at keeping people out of hospital With the number of patients expected to rise in the coming years particularly the group with multiple conditions that is clearly unsustainable With the right treatment many of these patients do not need to be in hospital But the fact remains that nearly three quarters of beds are occupied by someone with a long term condition The NHS Confederation recently looked at this issue concluding there needed to be a radical rethink Jo Webber director of policy at the confederation explains For too long the default setting when we think about healthcare or support is to think of a hospital But in reality acute hospitals whether major teaching sites or local district generals are rarely the best place for someone who needs ongoing health or treatment Mike Dixon of the NHS

the EU Why is the speech so significant What has happened Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech full text setting out his views on the UK s future in the European Union The speech has been months in the planning Why the big deal about the speech Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party and the UK Independence Party who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union There have been calls for a referendum to be held and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to bring back powers to Westminster from Brussels For months now the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech So what did Cameron say Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK s relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in out referendum after the next general election by the end of 2017 That obviously also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015 To see more of what he said here are selection of key extracts from the speech What sorts of powers does the UK want back The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech but there is a cross government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be brought back to the UK Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year The UK is also keen on opt outs from policing and criminal justice measures The 2010 Conservative manifesto said We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non euro EU members Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration so as part of negotiations there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK So does this all mean that the UK s going to leave the EU David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community in 1973 However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union No of course not You could choose a different path The question is what is in our national interest I ve always been very clear it s in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market What has been the reaction in the UK Eurosceptics seem seem pretty happy with the speech it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner party leader Nigel Farage called the PM s promise of an in out referendum his party s greatest achievement Pro Europeans have been unhappy with the speech Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a chilling effect on jobs and growth Ex European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it game set and match to the hardliners in Mr Cameron s party The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech Here is a round up of newspaper commentators verdicts What about the reaction around Europe The BBC s Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off leaving gracefully Guido Westerwelle German foreign minister said cherry picking is not an option French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe but you can t do Europe a la carte I ll take an example which our British friends will understand Let s imagine Europe is a football club and you join but once you re in it you can t say Let s play rugby Read more EU reaction What about the reaction from business A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU Some business leaders such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson have also called for changes in the UK s relationship with the EU The director general of the employers group the CBI John Cridland said closer union of the eurozone is not for us but Mr Cameron rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU Where can I get more detail

Angela Merkel agree on the urgent need to make Europe more competitive and flexible Downing Street has said After a meeting outside Berlin No 10 said both agreed they wanted faster progress on trade deals between the EU and the rest of the world They also discussed how G8 countries could take concrete action on tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance The prime minister and Mrs Merkel also discussed Syria Afghanistan and Iran Mr Cameron arrived in Berlin with his family on Friday and is staying at the chancellor s official guest residence Schloss Meseberg in the Brandenburg countryside Following talks No 10 said the two leaders also agreed that the EU should be prepared to make an ambitious offer in trade talks with the US Mr Cameron believes the EU needs to change to allow the UK along with other members not to be bound by all of its decisions In his keynote speech on the UK s future in Europe earlier this year Mr Cameron pledged to hold an in out referendum during the early part of the next parliament by the end of 2017 at the latest if the Conservatives win the next general election He has argued a new settlement is needed before UK voters are asked if they want to end ties with Brussels On the EU the PM set out his approach to European reform following on from his speech in January the Downing Street statement said of this weekend s meeting It said both leaders agreed on the urgent need to make Europe more competitive and flexible and talked about ways to achieve this And they discussed how we can work together in the run up to the May and June European councils to make further progress Mr Cameron and Mrs Merkel also discussed the forthcoming G8 summit which the prime minister is hosting at Lough Erne in Northern Ireland and the need to show global leadership in tackling tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance BBC Berlin correspondent Stephen Evans said people around Mrs Merkel confirmed she had questions for the prime minister about British sovereign territories which are tax havens He added that tax avoidance plays very strong in Germany a country keen on stopping people putting their money in bank accounts abroad and avoiding paying tax On Syria where Mrs Merkel is resisting pressure from the UK and France to lift an EU arms embargo to allow equipment to go to the rebels they agreed to keep working to find ways to increase pressure on the Assad regime while strengthening the moderate opposition Downing Street said both leaders share grave concerns about the deteriorating situation and the ongoing bloodshed Labour has previously said Mr Cameron s trip to Germany showed the prime minister was marooned between the demands of Tory backbenchers and what European leaders would accept", "The Scottish Conservatives have hit out at plans to hold a Holyrood debate on the legacy of former PM Margaret Thatcher on the day of her funeral The Scottish Greens have set aside their allotted parliamentary time on Wednesday to hold the debate Tory chief whip John Lamont said it was timed to cause the most upset He said the Greens should reconsider whether their narrow minded agenda was more important than the funeral of one of the UK s finest ever leaders The Green Independent group in the Scottish Parliament called for all MSPs to participate in the debate There will be no formal motion or voting The proposed title for the debate is There is still such a thing as society which alludes to an assertion made by Baroness Thatcher in 1987 In a magazine interview Mrs Thatcher said There s no such thing as society There are individual men and women and there are families The Conservative politician was UK prime minister from 1979 to 1990 winning three successive general elections She died on Monday aged 87 after suffering a stroke while staying at London s Ritz hotel Scottish Greens leader Patrick Harvie said Margaret Thatcher has died but the tragedy for huge numbers of people is that Thatcherism as an ideology still lives There are those on both sides of the independence divide who oppose the values of Thatcherism We aim to encourage honest consideration of the legacy of Thatcherism the core elements of which competition and selfishness continue to affect our society and our economy Despite her efforts to undermine Scotland s shared values and public services it is important to assert that our society still exists Mr Harvie added Collective solutions to shared problems are all the more important in light of the failure of the Thatcherite economic model By encouraging an open debate I hope we ll see a bit less of the tribal politics Holyrood has suffered of late and bit more of an effort to acknowledge our shared aspirations for Scottish society There are those on both sides of the independence divide who oppose the values of Thatcherism they will need to find ways to work together after the referendum whatever the result On Wednesday tributes were paid to the former prime minister in the House of Commons after the UK Parliament was recalled Prime Minister David Cameron told MPs at the start of a six hour specially convened session that Lady Thatcher defined and overcame the great challenges of her age Labour leader Ed Miliband said she had been a unique and towering figure but said he had disagreed with much of what she did", "Hundreds of thousands of households across the UK will be affected by changes to benefits from April part of government plans for the biggest shake up of the welfare system for decades Ministers argue the changes are necessary to tackle the rising cost to the taxpayer and cut the budget deficit They also say it will simplify the system and provide greater incentives for people to work However charities and opposition politicians say the moves will force families into rent arrears and increase homelessness What are the key changes who will be affected and by how much From mid April the government will introduce a cap on the total amount of benefit that working age people 16 64 can receive Set at the average earnings of a UK working household the cap will mean that people of working age will receive up to a maximum amount even if their full entitlement is higher The cap which will apply to England Scotland and Wales is estimated to be 350 per week for a single adult with no children and 500 per week for a couple or lone parent regardless of the number of children they have Ministers estimate that approximately 50 000 households will be affected by the cap losing an average of 93 per week Lone parents are expected to be the group most affected followed by couples with children Further analysis by the Children s Society estimates that children will be disproportionately affected by the changes Some 220 000 children will be hit the charity says compared to 90 000 adults The changes will not affect everyone at once Four London boroughs Bromley Croydon Enfield Haringey will try out the cap from April 2013 Other local authority areas will follow from 15 July with everywhere affected by September The benefit cap is not yet law in Northern Ireland To find out how you will be affected

adult or couple Up to two children under the age of 16 are expected to share if they are the same gender Those under 10 are expected to share whatever their gender Termed the single room subsidy by ministers or the bedroom tax by Labour the changes will result in 490m savings for the taxpayer in 2013 14 The government estimates that more than 660 000 claimants will be affected with an average loss of 14 per week Families with severely disabled children foster carers and families of armed services personnel will be exempt Couples with no children and older people those most likely to have

the biggest disability benefit payment In nine years the numbers claiming the benefit have risen from just under 2 5 million to 3 2 million an increase of about a third The changes are expected to reduce spending by about 2 2bn by 2015 16 with one fifth of current DLA claimants expected to be ineligible for PIP By 2015 some 170 000 people are expected to be ineligible while 150 000 will get a higher award according to the DWP By 2018 500 000 will be ineligible while 780 000 will receive the same or more than they do currently The government argues PIP will be more efficient and easier to understand than DLA However disability groups have condemned the plans as a money saving exercise arguing DLA is one of the most effectively targeted benefits with an estimated fraud rate of just 0 5 The change to PIP will be rolled out geographically over time From 8 April people living in Merseyside Cumbria Cheshire and North East England will begin claiming for PIP From 10 June all new claims for disability benefits will be for PIP and not DLA For more information read the government s guide In his 2012 Autumn Statement the chancellor announced that most working age benefits and tax credits would be uprated by just 1 a below inflation cap for three years from 2013 14 Benefits have historically risen in line with inflation and without any change would have been due to go up by 2 2 in April But the government argues that with public sector pay rises capped at 1 a similar limit should apply to working age benefits such as jobseeker s allowance employment and support allowance and income support as well as elements of working tax credits and child tax credit A total of 4 1 million households will be affected by the 1 limit in 2013 14 losing an average of 0 90 a week according

families in the UK will be abolished from April 2013 Currently the assessment of CTB is carried out by local councils on behalf of the Department of Work and Pensions DWP but the rules are nationally set and are applied in the same way across the UK However from April 2013 the government will provide funding to local authorities in England and to the Scottish and Welsh governments to design their own systems of Council Tax support know as Council Tax Support Schemes This funding will only be 90 of this year s budget for CTB in each local authority area meaning that local councils will be

England alone as well as give councils increased financial independence and establish stronger incentives for local authorities to get people back to work However critics say the changes mean different levels of support in different parts of the country and that this will prevent people being able to move to seek work For more information about changes to council tax benefit read the government s guide From the end of April the current system of working age benefits and Tax Credits will be gradually replaced by a new benefit called universal credit Millions of claimants will be affected Universal credit which applies to England Scotland and Wales will replace The government estimates 3 1 million households will be entitled to more benefits as a result of universal credit while 2 8 million households will be entitled to less Across all households ministers say there will be an average gain of 16 per month The transition to Universal Credit will take place in three phases over four years between 2013 and 2017 From April 2013 it will be trialled in Tameside Oldham Wigan and Warrington for an estimated 1 500 new claimants From October more claimants will move on to universal credit as and when they have a significant change of circumstances such as starting a new job or when a child is born Then from April 2014 until October 2017 the rest of those affected will be moved onto universal credit in stages Universal Credit will be rolled out in Northern Ireland from April 2014 six months after rollout in the rest of the UK begins For more information about universal credit visit the Department for Work and Pensions website", "With more than 300 seats at stake in whole council elections at four county and one unitary authority it is one of the biggest tests of Midlands political opinion in this famous electoral battleground area outside of a general election These councils are significant players in their own right they are responsible for major services including schools roads and refuse disposal However often the professional number crunchers and political soothsayers regale us with their interpretations of the wider electoral significance we should never lose sight of the huge influence these councils have on millions of people s lives That said let s get down to some serious soothsaying Inevitably we shall be looking to see if the Conservatives lose as many seats as their current poll ratings suggest whether or not Labour will be major beneficiaries or will UKIP pick up support from both of them And what of the Liberal Democrats Our four shire counties Gloucestershire Staffordshire Warwickshire and Worcestershire and one unitary authority Shropshire all go into these elections with substantial Conservative majorities so Labour strategists are managing expectations carefully Realistically their challenge is to make significant inroads into those Conservative majorities especially in Staffordshire and Warwickshire The other powerful factor at work beneath the headline story is that both the Conservatives and UKIP are coming off an especially high base year The last time these seats were contested in 2009 David Cameron s Tories were riding high in the polls while UKIP s support was boosted by the European elections being held at the same time This could make it difficult for UKIP to maintain any sense of momentum this time despite their encouraging poll ratings while for the Tories it may emphasise how their support has slipped between then and now But the Tories may privately reassure themselves with the notion that low turnouts are often thought to favour them over the other major parties given that there are no other elections to provide a collateral boost to the overall number of voters this time The other question lurking in the woodwork stems from my opening explanation about the four county councils and one unitary authorities that are going to the polls Gloucestershire Staffordshire Warwickshire and Worcestershire are all upper level authorities in a two tier system with district councils like Cheltenham Tamworth Wyre Forest and Stratford on Avon underneath them By contrast Shropshire s unitary council is responsible for the full set of local services Supporters of the unitary model notably Lord Heseltine in his recent No Stone Unturned report say it is far more efficient and easier for voters to understand Is it not confusing for voters for example that the districts collect their refuse and the counties dispose of it Lord Heseltine wants an active debate about more councils going the way not just of Shropshire but also of Herefordshire Telford and Wrekin and Stoke on Trent these last three are not going to the polls this year by the way He may be pleased to know it is already under way in Gloucestershire and Lord Heseltine certainly believes that with pressure on councils to share and merge more of their operations during this age of austerity it is an idea whose time has come We shall see And what of HS2 It is the issue that dominates politics in shire counties like Warwickshire and Staffordshire So how will it play into this campaign Will angry voters on the proposed route see it as their chance to give the government a kicking It s not as simple as that of course For a start the Conservative administrations in Staffordshire and Warwickshire have both come out against the project But for another all three main parties at Westminster are strongly in favour of it Leaving UKIP and the Greens to champion the opposition to it here All of which adds spice to the run up to the general election just over two years away and the European elections in 12 months time It was this same combination of elections last time round which offered a self fulfilling prophecy that the skids were under Gordon Brown s administration One fundamental objective for our current leaders will be to prevent the general idea getting around that history may be about to repeat itself", "The by election in South Shields to replace former Foreign Secretary David Miliband will take place on 2 May Labour sources have said Mr Miliband is expected

election in 2015 The 62 year old former Liverpool docker will be leader of Unite until 2018 Mr McCluskey said he was honoured to have been elected for a second time We are living in extraordinary times with workers facing unprecedented attacks on their living standards and their rights at work Now more than ever working people need a union which will stand up for them Mr McCluskey has been an active trade unionist since 1968 becoming an officer of the Transport and General Workers Union in 1979 and then national secretary for the General Workers group in 1990 In 2004 he was promoted to become the union s national organiser for all the service industries including public services construction and the voluntary sector Mr McCluskey later became Unite s assistant general secretary for

two years left of his term to run Since his election as general secretary in 2010 the Unite leader has set up a 25 million dispute fund to support union members financially and overall membership to the union has risen since his appointment He has been an outspoken critic of Ed Miliband s leadership despite having played a key role in getting him elected Unite the Labour party s biggest financial donor was one of several unions that criticised the shadow chancellor Ed Balls and the Labour leader Ed Miliband for backing the ongoing pay restraint in the public sector According to Mr McCluskey the party needs to put some flesh on the framework of an alternative and warns that if that alternative is not radical enough Labour will lose the next election In 2012 Mr McCluskey was heavily criticised for raising the possibility of protests during the Olympics with the Conservatives describing him as unpatriotic In an interview before the conference he told the BBC that he did not regret his comments about the Olympics despite the subsequent backlash He said he wanted a successful Olympics and he expected protests against the government s austerity programme to continue long after the Games were over On the recent benefit and tax changes announced by chancellor George Osborne Mr McCluskey said The sight of the chancellor exhorting the low waged in work to turn their backs on the poor out of work has to mark a new low for one of the highest offices in the land His opponent Mr Hicks from Bristol is an unemployed rank and file member of Unite He received 163 nominations to stand in the election compared with more than 1 000 for Mr McCluskey Jerry Hicks also stood against Mr McCluskey in the 2010 Unite election when he again came second but with 52 000 votes Unite has 1 5

secretary of state said it was a good opportunity for commitment to milestones and goals Theresa Villiers said money may be withheld if no progress is made If we can t agree the package yes it is a fact that we may not be able to deliver some of the things we are talking about and discussing The package under threat draws together several potential measures It includes incentives to establish enterprise zones There are 24 in England offering cheaper rates and lower levels of planning control Northern Ireland projects could also be given access to a UK scheme that funds major infrastructure

there was every chance agreement could be reached Ms Villiers denied such a condition amounted to blackmail A government source said no figure could be put on the amount of money involved He said the the type of thing they were talking about were incentives for the private sector including new business start ups access to funding and enterprise zones However the Secretary of State said a 153m funding package offered by the prime minister when the first and deputy first ministers visited Downing Street last month was not in jeopardy At that meeting David Cameron told Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness a decision on corporation tax was being delayed by 18 months So far the executive parties have failed to agree a new strategy on community relations The Alliance Party and the Ulster Unionists both quit a cross party working group complaining about the lack of progress Sinn F in MLA Daith McKay said Ms Villiers comment is a prime example of why the North needs to have economic autonomy The British government has failed to honour the financial package which flowed from the St Andrews Agreement he said The 4bn shortfall in this package has had a direct impact on the construction industry here We have seen decades of under investment in the North and if the British government believe withholding funding is going to make people integrate more they clearly have lost
