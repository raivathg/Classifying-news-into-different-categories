["The dilemma I m 21 I ve never had a boyfriend and something tells me I never will Recently my best friend who I ve known since kindergarten met someone her first boyfriend ever I m happy for her but it has made me realise how lonely I actually am I don t like showing my emotions because in my family emotions are regarded as a weakness People around me think I m heartless because I always have a stone face no matter what but on the inside I feel happiness pain and pleasure like any normal person I think this lack of emotion on the outside probably makes people from the opposite sex not want to be with me because I ll never giggle like an idiot just to make a guy think he s funny The only one who can read my emotions is my best friend I was tested at school and they said I have a higher than normal IQ I love reading I love learning new things and I ll never fake not knowing something just so another person can tell me about it This pushes people away from me they think I m rude and just won t talk to me No one knows how hollow and lonely I am I think I m going through a depression or something because I m always angry and I ve stopped laughing I haven t laughed out loud in months Please don t tell me Think positive Mariella replies Don t worry I won t I will however address your rather skewed notion of how to be attractive to the opposite sex I can t deny that there are men out there whose penchant is for a girl to giggle at their pathetic jokes and feign inferior intellect in order to elevate them in their own mythology Luckily they aren t the sort of partner that any woman with half a brain cell let alone the multitude you are clearly blessed with would want to date Experiencing a sense of failure because you ve failed to snare a boyfriend through Oscar worthy thespian skills is wholly irrational At 21 you are barely at the beginning of adulthood At this time you are far better working on your ability for meaningful interaction than on your flirting skills I m impressed that you and your best friend have held out so long against the allure of the boys in your peer group Watching kids today so eager to grow up that they re accessorising with a partner before they re mature enough to remember to brush their own teeth is pretty depressing I m wondering if it s your friend s perceived dating technique that you savage in your letter You say she only recently hooked up with her boy so you re not really lagging behind but the loss of her full attention may be hard to bear You won t be the first to mourn the passing of the intensity of teenage friendship I d certainly give some consideration as to how that has impacted on you and give your reaction some honest scrutiny Relationship highs and lows are extreme in youth and the more you can build up your confidence before you take the plunge the more rewarding any union will be You say things like you ll never giggle like an idiot which is troubling because sharing laughter with someone is not to be disparaged The sensation that someone gets you whether male or female friend or lover is one of life s real gifts If you re fretting about how you are perceived and self conscious about expressing yourself then you are building quite an obstacle to friendships let alone any prospective lover It s not the job of others to peel away the artifice and hunt out your unique core neither is there anything to fear in revealing yourself in all your complicated emotional glory Understanding the legacy of being raised not to show your feelings and attempting to break from your conditioning are separate challenges Having identified the first it s time you moved on to the second I can t claim any further Damascene insights into your character than those which you ve already highlighted but my overall sense is that you are in the throes of a great deal of resentment and self pity neither of which is conducive to the emotional abandonment you hunger for It s wonderful to have a best friend with whom you enjoy a profound and instinctive communication but as you grow into adulthood self reliance is the holy grail You are young smart and aware of what you need to work on If you can t shake your melancholy ask your GP for help but I m pretty sure you can get there on your own two feet If you have a dilemma send a brief email to mariella frostrup observer co uk To have your say on

has found Several hospital trusts said they had compensated patients following repeated allegations made against a doctor but had not referred the incidents to the General Medical Council GMC Some doctors have been involved in up to six unreported incidents The Department of Health said trusts had a legal duty to ensure their doctors were fit to practise Individual trusts are also responsible for disciplinary action against staff but there is no duty to pass on information about complaints to future employers Responding to a freedom of information request made to 163 NHS hospital trusts by 5 live Investigates 13 said they had failed to inform the GMC about at least one doctor whose actions had resulted in more than one compensation payout in the last five years Additionally at around half of those trusts some doctors had moved to other NHS trusts which were not told about the previous complaints Surinder Venables 49 was admitted to Basildon Hospital in September 2008 for a minor operation to remove three cysts Dr Nikolaos Papanikolaou performed a procedure in which he perforated her uterus when he tried to remove what he thought was abnormal tissue The GMC later found that he failed to recognise he had done this and failed to stop the procedure and ask for help As a result Ms Venables had to have several further operations and died following a cardiac arrest on 25 October 2008 Earlier this month Dr Papanikolaou was struck off the medical register by the GMC after it found numerous allegations related to seven cases were proven Five of these allegations related to his patients at Basildon hospital in the six months before Mrs Venables was admitted In one case the GMC found him responsible for failing to carry out a caesarean on a high risk patient which led to a still birth The hospital said that it carried out a full investigation following her death in 2008 But the hospital trust did not report Dr Papanikolaou to the GMC That was later done by the father of another of his patients who suffered poor care at Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital in January 2011 Only then did the GMC consider his case and following referral to an independent panel strike him off the medical register Dr Papanikolaou has 28 days to appeal against the GMC s decision It seems that an ideological distaste for regulation is being put before patient safety Ms Venables brother David Marjara said he was devastated about the circumstances of his sister s death He said His practices should have been looked into deeply and if there was any doubt whatsoever then he should have been reported to the General Medical Council These people should be investigated properly by the hospital and the NHS and then they should not be allowed to work Dr Papanikolaou was placed under supervision in October 2008 In a statement the Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS trust said When his employment came to an end the trust immediately contacted his new employer Ashford St Peter s Hospitals NHS Trust to inform them of concerns around some aspects of his clinical work Dr Papanikolaou later went on to work at the Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital where he was found by the GMC to have made a further six errors in relation to one patient in January 2011 5 Live Investigates has found that some NHS trusts have not told employers or the GMC of concerns about doctors who have allegedly been involved in poor practice In response to a freedom of information request one trust the Queen Elizabeth Hospital King s Lynn NHS Foundation Trust reported that 42 of its doctors had been the subject of more than two patient complaints Of those doctors 27 were involved in incidents which resulted in a compensation payout The trust said none of those doctors was referred to the GMC In a statement the trust said There were no GMC issues that needed to be passed on to another employer amongst these cases It added that its policy sets out a range of ways of addressing potential concerns about practice only one of which is a direct referral to the General Medical Council GMC Clinical negligence claims are complicated often involve more than one member of staff and the reasons that they may be settled are numerous and varied Since 2010 the responsible officer at each NHS trust has been under a professional obligation to refer concerns about doctors to the GMC Peter Walsh the chief executive of Action Against Medical Accidents said It seems that an ideological distaste for regulation is being put before patient safety Too much faith is placed in local systems of clinical governance failing to acknowledge conflicts of interest which lead to things being kept in house or swept under the carpet Employers have no statutory obligation to share information or even to refer serious cases to the GMC or other regulators Niall Dickson chief executive of the GMC said We have introduced local teams to work with the NHS frontline regular checks on all doctors through revalidation and new guidance to support doctors to raise concerns to help with this effort but we know there is more to do A spokesperson for the Department of Health said Responsible officers a senior doctor in each NHS Trust also have a statutory personal responsibility to ensure that all doctors in their organisation are fit to practise and are appropriately trained

incomplete data suggested the hospital had a mortality rate twice the national average but they resumed this week Prof Sir Roger Boyle told the BBC Leeds remains on the edge of acceptability Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said it has comparable rates to all other centres and there should be no concern The children s heart surgery unit was closed for 11 days after NHS England s medical director Sir Bruce Keogh suspended procedures for what he called a constellation of reasons These included an apparent higher mortality rate than the national average concerns raised by families treated at the hospital and reports from two senior surgeons at other units The mortality data had been leaked by Sir Roger director of the National Institute of Clinical Outcomes Research which oversees mortality figures across the NHS the night before last month s suspension A rapid response team was dispatched to Leeds General Infirmary last weekend to assess the immediate safety concerns that triggered the suspension NHS England said that assurances had been received about the quality of surgery and staffing levels that were sufficient to allow the phased resumption of operations Earlier this week Sir Bruce told the BBC he would now trust his own baby to be treated at the unit However speaking to BBC Radio 4 s The Report Sir Roger the Department of Health s former National Director for Heart Disease said he still would not send his children to Leeds I tell you that I have a young daughter I would go somewhere else I would go to Newcastle When asked whether operations should have remained suspended Sir Roger said It s not my decision I ve not been involved in the inspections I did my duty to say there is a concern here and that s all I said Sir Roger said that despite safety assurances over Leeds General Infirmary the full analysis of the data called for the children s heart surgery unit to remain under supervision We find they re just on the edge of what we call an alert In other words showing that they were at right on the edge of acceptability Figures from NHS England confirm that Leeds was very close to the alert threshold NHS England data highlights that two other children s heart units are also close to this threshold Alder Hey Children s NHS Foundation Trust and Guy s and St Thomas s NHS Foundation Trust The document containing these figures states these findings do not indicate a safety problem in any centre However centres with three year outcomes approaching the alert threshold may deserve additional scrutiny and monitoring of current performance Guy s and St Thomas s did not wish to comment on the findings but a spokesperson for Alder Hey said that while it was yet to see the numbers we are pleased to learn that all children s heart units in England including Alder Hey are safe In response to Sir Roger s comments Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said analysis had shown Leeds to have comparable rates to all other centres The Report will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Thursday 18 April at 20 00 BST Consultant cardiologist at Leeds General Infirmary Dr John Thomson said Sir Roger s assessment was unfair I haven t had a chance to fully scrutinise these graphs but in a rough look at the graphs I m not absolutely sure that they re accurate he explained We are still going through some of this data I would say that the wording is unfortunate there Sharon Cheng of Save Our Surgery which campaigned for surgery to be resumed at Leeds said Sir Roger Boyle s comments contradicted the rulings of NHS England the Care Quality Commission and NHS medical director Sir Bruce Keogh who all said the unit was safe Let me be absolutely clear the Leeds unit would not be operating if there were any concerns whatsoever about mortality rates or anything else she said Once again this is an example of Sir Roger Boyle speaking out without due regard to the necessary process the verified facts or the implications of his actions on patients and their families He is not an impartial party in regards to Leeds and as an adviser to the Safe and Sustainable review we do question his motives Stuart Andrew MP for Pudsey Horsfirth and Aireborough also said there was no basis for Sir Roger s comments The only person who seems to have a problem is Sir Roger Boyle What is his other role To advise the Safe and Sustainable Review into the long term future of heart surgery He chose Newcastle and now here he is again He has clearly shown his hand and this is awful frankly he said", "Listening to new music is rewarding for the brain a study suggests Using MRI scans a Canadian team of scientists found that areas in the reward centre of the brain became active when people heard a song for the first time The more the listener enjoyed what they were hearing the stronger the connections were in the region of the brain called the nucleus accumbens The study is published in the journal Science Dr Valorie Salimpoor from the Rotman Research Institute in Toronto told the BBC s Science in Action programme We know that the nucleus accumbens is involved with reward But music is abstract It s not like you are really hungry and you are about to get a piece of food and you are really excited about it because you are going to eat it or the same thing applies to sex or money that s when you would normally see activity in the nucleus accumbens But what s cool is that you re anticipating and getting excited over something entirely abstract and that s the next sound that is coming up New tunes To carry out the study which took place at the Montreal Neurological Institute at McGill University the scientists played 19 volunteers 60 excerpts of new music based on their musical preferences As they were listening to the 30 second long tracks they had to the opportunity to buy the ones they liked in a mocked up online music store All of this was carried out while the participants were lying in an MRI machine By analysing the scans the scientists found that the nucleus accumbens was lighting up and depending on the level of activity the researchers could predict whether the participant was likely to buy a song Dr Salimpoor said As they are listening to this music we can look at their brain activity and figure out how they are appreciating or enjoying this music before they even tell us anything And that s part of this new direction that neuroscience is going in trying to understand what people are thinking and inferring their thoughts and motivations and eventually their behaviour through their brain activity The researchers found that the nucleus accumbens was also interacting with another region of the brain called the auditory cortical stores This is an area that stores sound information based on music that people have been exposed to before This part of the brain will be unique for each individual because we ve all heard different music in the past explained Dr Salimpoor The researchers now want to find out how this drives our music tastes and whether our brain activity can explain why people are drawn to different styles of music You can hear more about

newspapers discuss content is the way in which photographs are now more often described as images On the face of it this smacks of aggrandisement However it probably reflects accurately what people feel about photography in a self regarding and digital age Snaps no longer hits the spot People appear much happier wearing their insides on the outside a bit like the Lloyd s building in London and publishing those images on social networks However for those who have a poor self image for whatever reason it can be a tough age in which to live Those who have a problem that is also a wider issue in society can find it portrayed in the media in a deeply upsetting fashion This poses a difficulty for news organisations attempting to illustrate such sensitive issues Obesity tends to be a problem that is most often illustrated by pictures of people without their faces showing But a picture editor s best endeavours can backfire for those who take a different view of what obesity means for an individual Angela Meadows a campaigner trying to improve the way people suffering from obesity are portrayed in the media complained about an image published on the Society website on 3 January 2013 The story in question reported on moves by Westminster council to reduce benefits for obese people who do not follow doctors orders to exercise she wrote The vast majority of images of fat people in the media are highly stigmatising and dehumanising most often what we call the headless fatty No head shown from the back shown spilling out of their clothes shown putting a doughnut into their disembodied mouth that kind of thing It is these kinds of images that have resulted in a massive increase in weight stigma increasing body dissatisfaction and an increase in eating disorders and related problems in ever younger people This dehumanisation also seems to promote the legitimacy of attacks on heavier people just because of the way they look that would be illegal if directed against somebody because of say their skin colour Meadows is not a lone campaigner in this area The US based Yale Rudd Centre for Food Policy and Obesity researched the media portrayal of fat people and the effect of this on perceptions and attitudes Meadows pointed out that the Rudd Centre has created an image library for use by media outlets that features photographs of obese people with heads doing a range of everyday activities allowing them to be portrayed as human beings Positive images appear harder to come by in the UK and since her letter at the beginning of the year there have been at least two occasions when the Guardian has used the headless fatty to illustrate articles about obesity Rory Foster the deputy letters editor who also works for part of the week in the readers editor s office passed Meadows complaint on to the Guardian s picture desk and other relevant sections of the paper and replied to her He told Meadows Many of the stock pictures that come up when one searches our picture archives for the term obesity are indeed of the headless fatty type that you refer to The reason they are taken this way is I would assume not from an intention to stigmatise but from pretty much the opposite a wish not to stigmatise or offend the person whose picture has been taken who may object to being identified Meadows responded that she understands the protecting their identity argument which is regularly put forward However she says that the very fact that obese people are thought to need their identities protecting is indicative of the attitude towards obesity It s an interesting point and difficult to get right for news organisations Obesity does lead to ill health a major NHS problem and there are plenty of people unhappy with being obese who would be unwilling to be used as a stock picture to illustrate the problem others clearly resent being turned from a person into a torso The best course wherever possible is that the Guardian should make every effort to use pictures of the real people in stories identifiable or not as they wish", "Beijing s Tianlong bird market fell silent two weeks ago The gentle sounds of cooing pigeons that usually fill the open air market have been replaced by nervous chatter among the market s remaining stall owners Sales of racing pigeons have been banned by Chinese health authorities fearful of the spread of the newest strain of bird flu to hit China H7N9 Tianlong s birds were transported away from the market s location in south west Beijing leaving a handful of stalls offering empty cages and birdseed Those who mainly sell pigeons and birds can t even afford to buy meals explains Zhang Mingbao a stall owner as he fidgets with his mobile phone People like us who sell bird food and medicine can barely cover our rent because of the declining sales People are more aware of self protection now Zhang s business suffered setbacks during previous health crises following an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Sars in 2002 and subsequent rounds of bird flu that have swept China However this time the government acted unusually quickly to ban bird sales In 2003 and 2004 our market was shut down too during the H1N1 bird flu scare but the situation wasn t as serious as it is now Zhang explains Not that many people died then More people died this year and people are more aware of self protection now Health authorities are rushing to contain the H7N9 bird flu virus after it first surfaced in February Thirty three people in mainland China have already been infected with this year s strain of the bird flu and nine people have died So far all of the infected people are thought to have caught the flu after direct contact with sick birds No cases of human to human transmission have been recorded Chinese authorities are attempting to stop the virus by culling hundreds of thousands of birds at poultry markets and farms in the large metropolis of Shanghai and Shanghai s neighbouring Jiangsu province where most of the cases are centred Other live bird populations including the carrier pigeons that are normally sold at the Tianlong market are also under strict watch Pigeon racing is a popular activity in China but most races have been cancelled for the foreseeable future Pigeon enthusiasts in Beijing and Shanghai have been told to keep their birds in cages Meng Xianghu a stall owner at another pigeon market the Wanliu Tonghe market in Beijing isn t questioning the government s decision to stop bird sales even though there is no evidence that H7N9 has spread to Beijing We have to listen to the people above us she says This is a matter of life and death Others aren t so trusting Many users of Weibo China s version of Twitter have questioned the government s efforts to deal with the H7N9 bird flu Many point to the attempted cover up of the Sars outbreak in 2002 as evidence that health officials might be hiding the severity of the current crisis The problem is not that the government releases the information too quickly but that it always has this internal logic that prefers to delay and conceal information says Dr Guo Weiqing a professor at the School of Government at Guangzhou s Sun Yat Sen University The excuse is that it wants to prevent panic It is correct to force the government to be more transparent Stall owners at the pigeon market say they have no idea how long they ll have to wait before business resumes We can only follow this path as it unfolds shrugs Mr Zhang from the empty Tianlong market But of course we are worried", "A girl of seven is being treated in hospital in Beijing in the first case of H7N9 bird flu reported by Chinese officials in the capital The child whose parents are poultry traders developed a fever sore throat and headache on Thursday Her condition is said to be stable Two people in close contact with her were quarantined for observation but have shown no symptoms so far The UN had recorded 28 cases and nine deaths in China as of Wednesday There are no reported cases outside the country according to the World Health Organization WHO China s national disease control centre confirmed on Saturday that the girl take ill in Beijing had the H7N9 virus The first cases of the virus were reported in February in eastern China According to the WHO there is no evidence that the H7N9 virus is being transmitted between people and most cases come from poultry International health experts have commended China on its transparency in reporting the spread of the virus in sharp contrast to its handling of a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Sars outbreak in 2003 when 8 096 people were infected worldwide and 744 died", "Margaret Thatcher is famously said to have slept for only four hours a night How easy is it to do a high powered job on this amount of sleep Part of Margaret Thatcher s fearsome reputation came from how little she slept She could get by on four hours a night it has often been said Indefatigability became part of her mystique She would keep her officials up working on a speech until two or three in the morning and then be up by five in time to listen to Farming Today She slept four hours a night on weekdays says Sir Bernard Ingham her Downing Street press secretary I wasn t with her at weekends I guess she got a bit more then It isn t easy to ascertain when Baroness Thatcher first referred to her minimal sleep schedule but the figure of four hours has passed into lore People use it as a benchmark of endurance often jokingly referring to those who need much more Lady Thatcher s close friend and former Conservative Party treasurer Lord McAlpine stayed with her at Chequers during the holidays She worked right through Christmas When everyone else went off to bed she went off to work Her biographer John Campbell author of The Iron Lady says her late to bed early to rise routine made her the best informed person in the room Occasionally husband Denis would snap Woman bed he is reputed to have shouted on one occasion We often worry about lying awake in the middle of the night but it could be good for you A growing body of evidence from science and history suggests that the eight hour sleep may be unnatural Her frugal sleep pattern created a problem for her successor John Major He found it difficult coming after her because the civil service had got used to a prime minister who never slept and he used to sleep eight hours a night Campbell says Sleep comes to be seen as part of a leader s character When Napoleon Bonaparte was asked how many hours sleep people need he is said to have replied Six for a man seven for a woman eight for a fool For the Iron Lady four hours was a badge of almost superhuman strength It fits the narrative of the warrior prime minister as set out by the Times Matthew Parris this week She understood that this was war when others didn t And in war you need a warrior he writes Churchill survived on four hours a night during the war But what is less often noted is that he had regular afternoon naps in his pyjamas Lady Thatcher was not one for these afternoon sleeps No she wasn t a napper Ingham says But is the four hour measure something ordinary people should aspire to In the world of business it is certainly something people strive for High profile chief executives from Marissa Mayer at Yahoo to Pepsi s Indra Nooyi get by on four hours a night while Donald Trump claims to survive on three Geraint Anderson author of City Boy who worked as an analyst and stockbroker for 12 years recognises the phenomenon For the Iron Lady four hours was a badge of almost superhuman strength There was a real macho competition in the City about sleep One of the ways of getting respect was bragging about how little you got The hours were long from 6 30 in the morning to seven at night Socialising might mean staying out till three in the morning And this was just the analysts The corporate financiers were the real hard workers They d work into the early hours get a couple of hours kip at the office and start again To admit needing sleep was a sign of weakness After the Christmas or summer party you d make sure you stayed the latest and came in a little earlier than normal the next morning Margaret Thatcher was not the cause but her name was regularly invoked by his bosses They d say she can get by on four hours to run the country And she s an old lady As well as business there have been military leaders who eschewed the eight hours and opted for the Spartan Thatcher credo General David Petraeus ate one meal a day and slept only four hours a night it was reported There s no correct amount of sleep says Prof Kevin Morgan of Loughborough University s sleep research centre The only rule is to sleep long enough to feel refreshed when you wake up For about 1 of people probably including Thatcher this will be as little as four hours a night says Morgan You can t just suddenly become someone who sleeps this little he argues It s likely to have been a pattern common to her life before becoming prime minister It is a big advantage for visionary or creative people to be part of this so called sleep elite And for a statesman attending all night summits it might be a huge advantage The people around you are flagging When people get tired the quality of their decision making is compromised Prof James Horne also at Loughborough s sleep research centre says that mood is critical Soldiers high on adrenalin can function on little sleep It all depends if one gets a buzz out of what one s doing If you re despondent you tend to sleep more if you re excited you need less Margaret Thatcher was someone who felt on top of things The average adult sleeps seven hours a night but many sleep considerably less than this especially people over 50 So it s possible that Thatcher fell within the range of normality rather than the 1 Horne argues She may have sometimes slept four hours and made up for her deficit by sleeping a little longer on other nights You tend to attribute great things to great people that they need no sleep or no food and have superhuman qualities Parris who was a fellow Conservative MP of Thatcher s during the 1970s and 1980s says it was probably more like four to five hours rather than the three to four that some have suggested It took its toll and may have led to poor decisions he believes Despite her toughness she was often tired out he remembers When we were jammed into the lobby I would be looking at her from six inches away I would often see the eyes of an exhausted woman Recently there has been a move away from ostentatious sleeplessness Burning the midnight oil in Gordon Brown s case was perceived as evidence of obsessive worrying and weakness The work life balance has arrived even in Number 10 Blair slept longer than Thatcher and Brown but made an exception to get up at night for baby Leo George W Bush was in bed by 10 unlike his predecessor Bill Clinton who worked late and got by on four or five hours For artists sleep deprivation carries a whiff of creative drive and raucous hedonism Keith Richards the Rolling Stones guitarist once stayed awake for nine days when he fell asleep he fell down so quickly that he broke his nose He makes a worse advert than Lady Thatcher did You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and

200 people in the UK donated their organs in the last year leading to about 3 100 transplants The increase has been largely credited to the network of specialist nurses who approach and support bereaved relatives in hospitals But with the numbers on the organ donation register remaining unchanged the NHS Blood and Transplant service is still asking people to sign up Sally Johnson from NHS Blood and Transplant said The NHS has worked hard to ensure every potential donor is identified that the organ donation register is checked and that families are approached Andrea Bradley at Morriston Hospital Swansea decided to become an organ donation nurse after her father received a corneal transplant She is the first person to suggest approaching a bereaved family about organ donation You are asking a family to make a decision at the most difficult time of their lives I give them all the information and hold nothing back Most are in shock it is an art form to gauge if the family understands what you are saying No one has ever been angry with me when I suggest the possibility of organ donation If donation goes ahead I stay with the patient throughout putting their information on the system to find a match going to theatre with them and then the chapel of rest I ring the family if they would like to know I tell them what was retrieved Later I meet with them and can tell them how the people who received the organs are doing But the NHS can t do it on its own We need a transformation in donor and family consent because the UK s family refusal rate remains one of the highest in Europe Last year 125 families overruled an individual s intention to donate Ms Johnson said It is important families know their relative is signed up to the register On the worst day of their lives don t let families guess In 2008 the UK s health ministers accepted the recommendations of the Organ Donation Taskforce These included better identification of potential donors improved referral of potential donors and improved care of donors to increase the number of organs available around three organs were retrieved last year for every donor Each donor has the potential to help nine people through donation of a heart lungs two kidneys pancreas liver and small bowel and two corneas Since the Taskforce report recommendations five years ago Scotland and Northern Ireland have seen the largest increases in deceased donors 74 and 82 respectively And the actual number of transplants in the UK is up by 30 the difference between the increase in donors and transplants is partly down to organs from some who wish to donate being unsuitable because of factors such as age and obesity But with three people in the UK dying a day because of a lack of donor organs many experts believe more need to be done Dr Vivienne Nathanson from the British Medical Association says the donation system needs an overhaul Referring to recent research she said We concluded the best way forward for the UK was to introduce an opt out system with safeguards The plan would mean people were deemed to consent to organ donation unless they object during their lifetime This system is being considered for introduction in Wales in two years time Ministers in Northern Ireland recently announced the intention to consult on public attitudes towards organ donation including the introduction of an opt out system", "These two chin strokers look like they re up to no good Who are they They re the founding editors of Ladybeard What is Ladybeard A quarterly print only feminist magazine in the

Breaking the Waves she s worked with some of Hollywood s most interesting names Paul Thomas Anderson who went on to direct the Oscar studded There Will Be Blood wrote Punch Drunk Love for her Steven Spielberg cast her in War Horse Robert Altman picked her to be his world weary housemaid Elsie in Gosforth Park She was nominated for another Oscar for her role in Hilary and Jackie the story of Jacqueline du Pr so to have her popping up in a BBC drama is something of a surprise and a delight But then it s as dark and vengeful as a Jacobean revenge tragedy at times a gripping political psychodrama and while Ed Balls can dream and only dream of having the sex appeal of David Tennant even aged up with ridiculous TV character hair it really ought to have had some lines of its own it s that arresting there is a certain quietly competent Yvette Cooper air that hovers around Emily Watson s performance Did Watson study her at all No Not specifically I mean I think Paula Milne the writer had that couple in mind But it s not supposed to be them or anybody specifically There are quite a lot of frontrunners at the moment who are women on both sides So I think that s quite interesting and what it does to a relationship when both partners want the top job She s right It is quite interesting And the marriage of the Balls Coopers is an inherently dramatic starting point in a Borgen meets The Borgias sort of a way What s more it s a drama with a backstory back in 1995 at the height of John Major s government when Back to Basics was the policy of the day and barely a week went by without some minister being caught with his mistress Milne wrote The Politician s Wife It was a huge hit for Channel 4 winning Baftas and Emmys and one of the factors no doubt that influenced Watson to take the role though she says she just read the script And I thought Ooh that s quite tasty Tasty in that Yvette and Ed or Aiden and Freya as they re called in this scenario are ambitious enough and ruthless enough to try and stitch each other up Despite having two children and a home together Aiden becoming unhinged when his wife replaces him in the cabinet She s quite an unusual female character says Watson in that she s very sexual but a faithful wife and mother And she s very ambitious and political but has the emotional intelligence to play a very subtle hand It s quite complex and I just enjoyed playing her And you know she had brushed hair and suits and make up and all that Really I say You liked the lady politician viscose blouses But that is true to life If you look at women in politics they all dress like men The currency of your sexuality is not you can t take it to work Whereas obviously in my job it s a big part of what I do It s a big part of who I am and there s no denying it Whereas I think in the political world you have to very strictly leave that at home And I think any politician who tries to be sexual or feminine is diminished It s an interesting observation particularly given Watson s career At 46 she says she plays a lot of mums these days Which is fine I am a mum after all She has two children Juliet seven and Dylan four in real life and on screen she was recently the mother in War Horse And she s currently commuting back and forth to Berlin where she s playing another maternal role in The Book Thief But in many ways her defining role and the one that first brought her to public attention was highly sexualised that of Bess in Breaking the Waves It was an extraordinary film and Watson was extraordinary in it It s funny she says a few days ago the Book Thief s director Brian Percival said to me Oh I watched Breaking the Waves again over the weekend And I was like Really I mean really Why It s just so extreme and so powerful and raw It was raw Watson played the role as if she d had her skin sheared off and maybe she had in a way it was her first film I had nothing to compare it to she says and when von Trier told her to open herself up to the role playing a naive God fearing Scottish girl whose husband suffers a grisly industrial accident and insists she goes out and sleep with other men it s exactly what she did How does it feel watching it now Do you still feel like that young wide eyed girl Well I wasn t that wide eyed really I was 28 and I d been to university I d been in the theatre I just managed to pull it off and make it look like I was But yes I look back on that and it was absolutely a shatteringly life changing experience It was huge It was a monumental experience not just in the making of the film but in the effect that it then had on my life It propelled her into the Hollywood elite And yet curiously not in a way I come across an old cutting that compared her with Kate Winslet The only two young British actresses who have genuine heavy weight status in America it claimed It seems unlikely that you d bracket the two of them together these days Watson has made her life in southeast London not Hollywood and has been married for nearly two decades Whereas Winslet has made let s say other choices There was a point where I was thinking about moving to LA says Watson I physically enjoy the place But it s the mental life you have to negotiate living there I just don t think I have the equipment to deal with it Her decisions have had their own stresses though As a jobbing actor before her big break she met and married fellow actor Jack Waters and while her career achieved super stratospheric lift off her husband just never quite got the break In The Politician s Husband Watson s character s growing ambition and career focus coupled with her husband s lack of success leads to a troubled female guilt male emasculation dynamic It s a tricky question to ask but have there been any parallels It s a very different scenario because being an artist you re not It doesn t have that same climbing a structure thing it s much more fluid And it s very much a part time job so when I m home I m very content to be the cooker and the washer Obviously I ve had a career that he hasn t had so that is an imbalance but as you get older I just feel that you don t have to judge your life by other people s standards It s what you make of it You just have to love the life you re in really These days she says the roles she accepts are entirely influenced by the impact they have on her family My career is totally controlled by that she says It s a huge part of my decision making process Where is it How long And how much Because if it s independent low budget no money eight weeks fantastic script sorry It has to be worth my while leaving for that long To keep everybody in nannies and school fees The geography issue is presumably why she has started to turn up in certain TV dramas She co starred with Dominic West last year in the Fred West drama Appropriate Adult for which she won a Bafta In the YouTube clip of it she looked genuinely stunned as opposed to faux oh my God actorly stunned and admits that she found it incredibly gratifying I ve just been to so many of those things and never won It was a bit of a monkey off my back But the role she s playing now she says of the multitasking mum is one she s enjoying Though it can be a bit surreal A day or two ago she d played a woman waving her husband off to the front in Nazi Germany And then I m driving back from the Polish border to get the late flight from Berlin and then going straight to Juliet s school play in the morning It can be a bit odd Somebody once told her that actors bodies can t distinguish between fiction and reality between invented emotion and real And I m sitting there and I have to remember that there s nothing wrong It s all good The Nazis aren t coming It s just London s Burning on the recorder The Politician s Husband is on BBC2 on 25 April at 9pm", "Twenty five years after Prozac was introduced the name has entered the cultural lexicon and helped define how people think of mental illness Back in the 1990s Prozac achieved what few prescription drugs ever do It was trendy The drug found fame among laymen fuelled in part by Elizabeth Wurtzel s bestselling book Prozac Nation Now it is part of the everyday lexicon The drug was introduced in the US in 1988 and in the UK the following year Since then it has become a cipher for discussions about mental illness and whether it should be treated by the talking cure therapy in which a patient works things out with the help of a professional or with drugs It was like bringing a meat cleaver down says novelist Sarah Dunant co editor of an anthology of essays The Age of Anxiety She has a personal experience with antidepressants saying they helped her through a tough time years ago She believes Prozac has had far reaching implications Things are not the same now as they were before Not everybody is happy about that What made Prozac good was not that it was potent which it really was not but that it had really good marketing says David Healy a professor at Cardiff University and the author of Pharmageddon They made us overcome the natural caution most of us have about pills and convince us that we absolutely had to have these things Healy says The marketing plan was subtle Manufacturer Eli Lilly picked a name created by Interbrand that aimed to distance the drug from everything typically associated with anti depressants strong chemicals side effects Prozac as both a drug and a concept caught on Prozac Nation had a cult following It was reissued in 2002 pegged to a movie starring Christina Ricci and sold more than 120 000 copies that year according to Publishers Weekly Through books and movies Prozac gave an almost chic gloss to mental illness in some people s eyes After Prozac Nation was published Wurtzel went home with a different man every night and did heroin every day she wrote recently in New York Magazine Prozac which now acts almost as a shorthand for all anti depressants appears in the Oxford English Dictionary People can have a Prozac moment which means fleeting happiness or forgetfulness They can also have a Prozac shot sambuca and schnapps Source Royal College of Psychiatrists Not surprisingly Prozac has also become a source of material for film directors In Steven Soderbergh s psychological thriller Side Effects a New Yorker takes pills for depression and Prozac is inevitably mentioned The drug has seeped into pop culture and also the lives of ordinary people Today Europeans and Americans take antidepressants at roughly the same rate In 2010 one in 10 people in Europe had taken them according to the Institute for the Study of Labour in Bonn In the US 11 of people over the age of 12 take antidepressants according to the US Centers for Disease Control research It s easy to conclude that the public image of Prozac has helped fuel social acceptance of antidepressant use But plenty of those who have prescribed drugs can be critical of the way they have been used There was this whole idea that Prozac made you better well I wasn t sure says Joanna Moncrieff now a senior clinical lecturer in neuroscience at University College London and author of forthcoming book The Bitterest Pills Moncrieff worked for years with patients in a 22 bed ward at a Brentwood mental hospital I spent a lot of time in the ward reducing medication she says The staff called me The Slasher Not everybody should be taking medication she says A hundred years ago if you didn t feel good you wouldn t have expected it to be eliminated Still she knows people will continue to take antidepressants Just as Viagra has changed lives and provided fodder for late night comedy skits Prozac has altered the national discourse about mental illness Many experts believe antidepressants are useful Manchester University s Ian Anderson a professor of psychiatry says that people should not take a dogmatic approach to the drugs In the end it s about getting on with your life he says I ve seen enough people just struggling along with depression That doesn t seem fair Dunant says antidepressants once got her through a bad breakup She says she wishes the drugs were around when her father a manager in the airline industry suffered a breakdown in the 1970s He had to undergo electroshock therapy It would have helped him through the most terrifying fall through the darkness she says Many people feel better when they are on the drugs But the precise mechanism is still not apparent Antidepressants have an effect on serotonin levels in the brain which seem to be related to emotional well being Yet the relationship between serotonin and happiness remains unclear We re a bit blind about this says University of Bristol s Stafford Lightman Researchers do not have an animal model to study the effects of the drugs There is no such thing as a depressed mouse Consequently there are leaps of faith when you take these drugs he says",

were being drowned out by a new noise I was still breathing fast and it slowly dawned on me that the sound I could hear was the pounding rhythm of my heartbeat Unable to focus on the discussion I felt an overwhelming sense of despair I have superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome SCDS a balance disorder It s a developmental anomaly that occurs during the first three years of life and is thought to be caused by a lack of bone deposition in the uppermost balance canal of the inner ear which can cause a tiny hole to develop I had two holes one on each side like about 50 of sufferers Sound or pressure can trigger abnormal activation of the balance canals in the ear which in turn leads to a wide range of distressing and disabling symptoms The holes in the bone are tiny but their effects are far reaching SCDS was discovered in 1995 by Dr Lloyd Minor an ear nose and throat specialist at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore Minor connected strange symptoms in a couple of his patients to a study of pigeons in which specific eye movements had been linked to damage to certain canals of the inner ear As he explained in a speech in 2011 Some of my first patients were referred to me by psychiatrists One man said he got dizzy when he sang in the shower Another said he could hear the sound of his own eyes moving I would later discover they were experiencing symptoms coming from inside their heads but not in the ways others might have supposed The fact that there is great variation in symptoms means many that more cases could be going undetected or misdiagnosed From my 20s I was sure something wasn t right I often felt nauseous unbalanced or both and little by little my confidence was eroded As a researcher for a book publisher I often worked in the British Library which I loved But I began to dread the walk from my desk to the central collection area The sound of trolleys moving books around or shelves being restacked seemed to be causing a feeling of unsteadiness and anxiety I put this down to some sort of panic attack These sensations gradually extended to other environments and fluctuated wildly which added further confusion This continued into my 40s Then in 2003 a sharp change of pressure during the descent at the end of a flight triggered the full range of symptoms A brutal pain in my left ear gradually morphed into a permanent feeling of pressure The inside of my head felt like a balloon I badly needed to burst My troubled ear led me to a GP followed by a series of ENT consultants at first near my home in Edinburgh then further afield in London and Oxford A clear MRI scan seemed to be my cue to disappear despite tests showing evidence of hearing loss but I was determined to persevere as my symptoms not only remained they were subtly changing I had been getting severe headaches the nausea was becoming persistent and it was extremely uncomfortable to raise my voice sing or eat crunchy foods Over the months the list of symptoms kept growing with blurred vision and vertigo among them I had no way of knowing that my years of unsteadiness were directly linked to the problematic ear and that the creaking noises in my neck or the clicking sounds from my eyes might be significant Months of research to find an explanation resulted in an email to Dr Dennis Poe a renowned Boston ear specialist He directed me to a doctor in Oxford to be evaluated for another unusual condition patulous eustachian tube where the tube that connects the inner ear to the nasopharynx doesn t stay closed but I came away instead with a diagnosis of SCDS later confirmed by a CT scan Referral for surgery should have set me on the road to recovery But an experimental procedure proved disastrous I came out of surgery in a worse state with terrible vertigo and pain After 18 exhausting months I went to see Dr Gerard Gianoli at The Ear and Balance Institute in Louisiana who has carried out more than 200 successful SCDS procedures It was he who established that my SCDS was in fact bilateral and performed successful revision surgery on the left side Surgery was an easy choice for me as the condition had taken control of my life But there were serious risks to consider including hearing loss and nerve damage These operations aren t an overnight fix as the brain has a lot of adjusting to do and the inner ear has to heal But now following a further repair on the right side I m at the start of a new and quieter life one without holes in my head For more information visit scdssupport org",

"Carl Lightbown had help dealing with his injury through the scheme Sick leave leads to long term absence from work in too many cases the government says It hopes a new scheme will get people off benefits and back to work much more quickly But will it work and will it be fair Carl Lightbown had a very common problem A work related injury But how it was treated was far from usual A few weeks into a new warehouse job Carl started having problems with his shoulder a classic complaint which afflicts many manual workers and could have led to months off work The easy option would have been for me to go home and spend weeks months on the sick he said But because Carl lived in Leicester he was able to use a government pilot scheme set up to help people like him back into work quickly before a few weeks off turned into months His GP referred him to the Leicestershire Fit For Work pilot which offers a free occupational health service available to employees in the area It also manages their return to work If you have been out of work for 20 weeks then you have a very low chance of returning to your own job This government funded assessment and advice service is expected to be up and running across England Scotland and Wales from next year The Fit For Work service was able to get Carl physiotherapy sessions immediately rather than him having to wait several weeks for an NHS appointment He was also offered help in arranging a phased return to work Basically they were there to support me while I was out he said His doctor had initially thought he would be off for several months but he was back at work in just under four weeks Julie Potts a director of North Supply where he works says the quick reaction of the Fit For Work service meant that Carl kept his job I m not sure if Carl had only had the support of the NHS whether he would still be employed she said The Leicestershire service is one of seven government backed pilot schemes which emerged out of the first of two reports on sickness absence written by Dame Carol Black adviser on health and work at the Department of Health Peter Day reports on The Sick Note for In Business on BBC Radio 4 at 20 30 on Thursday 11 April and at 21 30 on Sunday 14 April Around 300 000 people a year make claims for long term sickness benefit and sickness absence is costing Britain an estimated 15bn in lost economic output Dame Carol believes early intervention to help someone back to work is vital If you have been out of work for 20 weeks then you have a very low chance of returning to your own job that chance may be only 25 She said the problem is that too many people drop out of work for potentially manageable health reasons like stress or back pain and do not return It wastes human life It ruins people s sense of self worth dignity It s bad for families bad for the economy and bad for the community Lord Freud Minister for Welfare Reform has said that where employers suspect that sickness absence is being abused the new service will also offer an independent view of the situation He said that in a proportion of cases disciplinary action may be appropriate Source Department for Work Pensions The Department for Work and Pensions is still working on the details of the new scheme but Lord Freud said that most people would be expected to go to the service after four weeks of sickness absence unless there is a specified reason not to such as a serious long term illness He expects employers to contribute to the cost of some treatment such as private physiotherapy helped by a tax break announced in the last Budget Dame Carol Black has stressed that she wants to see a positive and proactive assessment service with disciplinary action a last resort But not everybody wants to see GPs lose control of their patients return to work Karen Jennings assistant general secretary of the public sector union Unison is worried that the new service once put out to tender could be target driven meaning some patients are forced back to work too early If you ve got targets you ll do everything that you can to make sure you meet those targets regardless of the individuals involved she said However Dr John Canning a GP in Middlesbrough and a committee chairman at the British Medical Association welcomed the changes I think it will be seen by many as another stick with which to beat people who are not well but everything that I have read so far suggests that it is a carrot But he is worried that the funding seems relatively little The government is spending up to 50m a year on the new service and Dr Canning is concerned about how robust it will be and whether it will be as resilient as we would like it to be He also welcomed the changes because they would relieve doctors of the need to negotiate with employers about their worker s return to work This began three years ago when the old sick note became a fit note It states what a patient is capable of doing rather than not doing and has room to suggest modifications to their work However it became apparent that assessing a patient s work capability and liaising with their employer was too big a task for GPs on their own The new service also aims to look beyond medical problems to other factors that may be preventing people going back to work Dame Carol recommended that the new service offer advice on issues which might be affecting a person s ability to do their job such as debt or difficulty with their line manager Case workers will have to find out a lot about people s lives and where the barriers are to returning to work said Dr Rob Hampton a GP in Leicester and a founder and clinical director of the Leicestershire Fit For Work Service He said that in a quarter of the cases they see poor relationships at work are behind sickness absence Find out more from In Business on BBC Radio 4 at 20 30 GMT on Thursday 11 April and at 21 30 GMT on Sunday 14 April", "This could be a bit hasty but it seems there may after all be one negative aspect of contemporary life for which the late Margaret Thatcher can be entirely exonerated She did not give anyone measles Almost a decade separates her departure from Downing Street and the moment in 1998 when Dr Andrew Wakefield launched the MMR health scare that caused escalating parental panic a massive and lasting drop in vaccination rates and thus years later the recurrence of measles outbreaks such as the one now putting Welsh children in hospital By the end of last week there were 693 confirmed cases of measles in Powys an increase of more than 70 in the previous two days In 1998 there were 56 cases in the whole of the UK It is a measure of the challenge facing health officials now pleading with parents of the unvaccinated that family websites are still hosting agitated debates about the Wakefield link between MMR and autism and the danger of overloading the infant system Last week one mother was describing MMR vaccination as the hardest decision I ve had to make in my life Sometimes reading such exchanges it seems the only significant advance since 1998 when parents including me began agonising about MMR is the increased availability of doctors who are willing to administer the injections singly as advocated by Wakefield in his infamous press conference at the Royal Free Hospital To the consternation of his panel of colleagues their star medic suddenly departed from an agreed line advocating continued use of MMR to declare that on the contrary it was a moral issue for him to caution parents about the jab given the potential connection with regressive autism I can t support the continued use of these three vaccines given in combination he said until this issue has been resolved If you happened to have just received an MMR call up for your child were not a doctor and were ignorant equally of Dr Wakefield s selection bias and his personal interest in single vaccinations to say nothing of editorial standards at the Lancet it was not the sort of warning to leave you cold In fact by the time I went in nervously for a twice postponed MMR I had also met read or watched a succession of informed doctors and health workers who regardless of his methods and the conflicting evidence thought Wakefield worth taking seriously Newspapers which are habitually blamed for spreading panic in the early days did not have to look far for clinicians or politicians with a similar indifference to herd immunity A 2001 survey in the BMJ found 13 of GPs and 27 of practice nurses still thought it was very likely or possible that MMR was associated with the development of autism In the same year Mrs Blair refused to disclose whether or not her son Leo had been immunised he had and in 2002 with MMR take up described as dangerously low Ken Livingstone with mayoral responsibility to promote public health advised Londoners to shun the injection There s no way I would inflict that risk on a child Clearly and not only in Powys where thousands of children are still at risk the subsequent debunking of Wakefield s never to be replicated paper its retraction by the Lancet the exposure of Wakefield s conflicts of interest the GMC investigation of Wakefield and his eventual striking off in 2010 have failed dismally to dispel old fears Nor did a 2005 Cochrane review of data finding no credible evidence of long term harm including autism destroy the market for private single injections for the affluent and Livingstone minded As neat as it is to think that the problem could have been solved Leveson style by say placing the troublesome Melanie Phillips under a stone or denying principal alarmists further access to post 1800 medicine the causes of public suspicion go deeper no offence to the Daily Mail than articles that have their irresponsible rivals in US MMR articles all available online And even the bravest of these anti MMR hacks might have retreated earlier in the face of overwhelming orthodox consensus had it not been for a rival establishment complementary medicine For its respectable proponents the lingering public suspicions about the MMR vaccination double so long as they can be sustained as a continually renewing market for their services Although hostility to and conspiracy theories about MMR vaccinations are common to many parts of the quack business homeopathy is notably dubious In a 2002 study by Ernst and Schmidt featuring an online query from a fictitious anxious mother not one out of 77 practitioners advised her in favour of the triple jab Since when while Wakefield has been discredited sympathetic homeopaths have prospered a few months ago Ainsworths the homeopathic pharmacy endorsed by Prince Charles had to be ordered by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency to cease advertising its own alternative and content free vaccine against measles Mercifully for Ainsworths what is considered dangerous by one part of government can still be cherished by another and not only via the appointment to the science and technology committee of Britain s foremost adherent of homeopathy and remote healing the Tory MP David Tredinnick It was Mr Tredinnick astrologers will recall who once had to repay 755 for constellation based health software he had included in his parliamentary expenses After some recent controversy when its content was discovered to have been interfered with by one of Prince Charles s many colleges of Charlesology the NHS Choices re re revised homeopathy page still makes it clear that this branch of magical thinking remains very much a part of the modern NHS While it asks the public to put science first in organ donation and swears never again to ignore hospital data the NHS tolerates for instance referrals to the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine where Hahnemann s absurd system is still passed off as respectable treatment Medicines which can produce an illness matching the one from which the patient is suffering are prescribed it informs homeopathy patients aiming to stimulate the body s own healing Summarising the discipline as rubbish the chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies has told Mr Tredinnick s committee I am perpetually surprised that homeopathy is available on the NHS Concerned perhaps to make her arcane language comprehensible to Mr Tredinnick and his fellow homeopathy fan Jeremy Hunt the outgoing chief scientific adviser Sir John Beddington characterised NHS homeopathy more recently as mad With the greatest of respect to the government scientists rubbish and mad still seem kindly descriptions of a licensed potentially harmful idiocy that so long as it is protected within the NHS affords professional respectability to the sort of homeopathy writers and practitioners who have nurtured parental suspicion and resistance to the MMR even after measles epidemics began to threaten children s long term health You can tell people to get immunised in accordance with the science or you can fund homeopathy in defiance of it you can t rationally do both Comments will be turned on later this morning", "Sex education in schools is at risk of being watered down if proposed changes to England s science curriculum go ahead experts have warned Sex education should be unambiguously included in science lessons a coalition of organisations has urged The science proposals omit any reference to genitalia puberty or sexual health says the group in a letter to the Times newspaper A government spokeswoman said the claims were misleading The draft science curriculum includes as much sex education as the current curriculum said the spokeswoman for the Department for Education Children will continue to be taught about their bodies physical development and reproduction The letter is signed by more than 100 organisations and individuals ranging from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to Mumsnet the Sex Education Forum and the National Children s Bureau It says the planned changes will not help schools create an honest and open culture around sex and relationships and urges the government to put any adult squeamishness about sex aside These proposals will result in more children starting puberty without knowing what is happening to them and without the words to name genitals The National Curriculum science is the only compulsory part of sex and relationships in education in schools and must teach children about how their bodies work to prepare them for growing up and to protect them from harm it says In particular the group is concerned that children will not be taught about sexual reproduction and puberty early enough and that some will already be experiencing changes in their bodies before they have been taught about them The Sex Education Forum SEF says that the plans leave a gap in teaching about reproduction in primary school In particular SEF highlights the section in the draft which says that six and seven year olds should be taught about the process of reproduction and growth in animals but which also says that at this age pupils should not be expected to understand how reproduction occurs The group adds that the draft curriculum does not mention reproduction again until the end of primary school when the guidance for teaching 10 and 11 year olds says they should find out about different types of reproduction including sexual and asexual reproduction in plants and sexual reproduction in animals Lucy Emmerson of the Sex Education Forum said At a time when children can easily access explicit sexual content on the internet there needs to be a reliable source of information on growing up and sex The government s own sexual health framework calls for an open and honest culture and to improve knowledge about contraception but this is not going to be supported by the science curriculum proposals It is the lack of courage to talk openly and honestly about sex and relationships and to guarantee every child s right to information about their health that has resulted in the UK having one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates amongst developed countries These proposals will result in more children starting puberty without knowing what is happening to them and without the words to name genitals This is a safeguarding issue as well as a health issue A Department for Education spokeswoman said While the new draft curriculum focuses on core science we expect teachers to cover sexual health when they teach about reproduction In addition the secretary of state s statutory guidance ensures all pupils receive age appropriate sex and relationship education Pupils must learn about sexually transmitted infections such as HIV Aids as well as the importance of stable relationships and marriage They must also learn the how the law applies to sexual relationships and understand concepts such as sexual consent This has not

experts said people needed to take more care of their kidney health The research by a team at the University Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands looked at more than 300 people who had either a healthy bodyweight or who were overweight They found that having a higher waist to hip ratio seen in those who were more apple shaped was associated with lower kidney function reduced kidney blood flow and higher blood pressure in the kidneys This was the case even in those who were otherwise healthy Arjan Kwakernaak who led the study said We found that apple shaped persons even if totally healthy and with a normal blood pressure have an elevated blood pressure in their kidneys More needs to be done to make people aware of the importance of protecting kidney function When they are also overweight or obese this is even worse The findings suggest that these individuals may benefit from treatments that reduce kidney blood pressure such as cutting salt levels and targeted drug treatments A spokesman for Kidney Research UK said We understand already that central apple obesity is associated with higher cardiovascular risk than peripheral pear obesity This demonstrates that the same is true for kidney disease He added This is further evidence that there is a link between obesity and the growing problem of kidney disease and that more needs to be done to make people aware of the importance of protecting kidney function", "Like so many modern couples Tom Wang and his wife met online On their first date in a teahouse he admired her femininity They married a year later and are now negotiating the decor of their new flat Wang hopes they will grow old together yet refused to pay for her wedding ring and is wary of having a child I have a headache when I talk about that said the 40 year old software engineer with a half smile half grimace His wife is not family not even a friend he said merely a partner in their joint endeavour He is gay she lesbian The marriage is a facade erected to satisfy their parents and protect their careers Though homosexuality was illegal in China until 1997 and remains a sensitive issue the country does not have the deep rooted vicious homophobia of many other places For most of its history it not only tolerated male same sex love but also celebrated it writes Richard Burger in Behind the Red Door a history of sex in China But such relationships supplemented marriage rather than replaced it According to the tenets of traditional society the worst kind of unfilial behaviour is failing to continue the family line Even now the pressure to marry and have children is intense Zhang Beichuan an expert on homosexuality at Qingdao University believes about 80 of gay men and lesbians marry Most wed straight partners unaware of their spouses sexuality Others such as Wang find a homosexual partner of the opposite sex by asking friends or advertising online One woman in her early 20s writes on one such website I have promised my parents I will marry by 2014 I am looking for someone who is simple honest has an apartment does not want a child We won t disturb each other The marriage will last at least five years Another says she and her girlfriend are out to please their parents but want a baby As an openly lesbian couple they would face social stigma birth control policies also make life harder for children born to single mothers I want to find someone who is healthy not bad looking intelligent kind and cheerful she states You don t need to raise the kid but I hope you are a father who will love the kid and be a male role model Wang not his real name spent five years seeking a suitable bride For men the pressure to marry starts in their early 30s he said for women much earlier His wife almost a decade younger than him also wanted to allay her parents suspicion after they reacted angrily to her attempts to come out Wang bought time by telling his family that Shanghai girls would not look at him until he had a flat His sister asked outright if he had physical problems My parents are from the countryside Everyone compares themselves with each other especially about their children he said It was a big deal that I went to university in the city and got a good job so why couldn t such a great guy find a wife and have children That was a lot of pressure for my parents Even in the city being openly gay could really harm you at work he says Simply being single is a problem I work for a foreign company so it s not so bad because they respect personal privacy but they still want you to take your girlfriend or wife to company events If you are single people think you re weird They feel you are more responsible and mature after you marry They also feel you have a family to feed so maybe they should give you a chance said Wang Thanks to such pressures as many as 12m gay men are married to straight women estimates Xing Fei of the Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences Wang said he never considered that option I know if a woman loved me I couldn t give her the love she would expect or want For a woman that s tragic he said Xing said others wanted to avoid a straight partner s sexual demands But marriages of convenience bring their own difficulties Some of these marriages are good they can help and support each other but most don t last long warned Zhang Couples may agree in advance to an early divorce Others find cohabiting and sharing family duties harder than expected Splitting up can bring disputes over children and property In Wang s case their property is registered in their own names They have also covered every detail they could think of he will pay all travel costs for visiting his parents for example in written terms that are not legally binding but make their mutual expectations clear They will have separate rooms but share a bed when his family comes to stay They will not give a key to her parents who live nearby lest they pop in unexpectedly I m

across Wales Wales seven health boards were asked for a list of stolen property during the last five years under a Freedom of Information FOI request by BBC Wales The most expensive theft was 78 000 worth of cable Across Wales the list also includes wheelchairs a Philips X ray machine and a 4 128 Transit van Campaign group Patient Concern said hospital security was a big problem The health boards were also asked for details of all recorded thefts and their values They were also asked who met the cost of replacing the equipment and whether patient care was affected Dr Paul Worthington speaking on behalf of the Board of Community Health Councils in Wales said We are reassured that patient care isn t affected However he added Any money that has to be spent on replacing stolen items or equipment from hospitals is money that can not be spent on patient care He urged patients to return borrowed medical equipment such as crutches Cardiff and Vale suffered the most expensive theft in 2011 12 when 78 207 60 worth of cable was stolen from the University Hospital of Wales Cardiff and Llandough Hospital in the Vale of Glamorgan Hospital security is very difficult you don t want barriers and armed guards at the entrance In December 2011 Llandough was forced to postpone more than 80 operations due to cable thefts However in its FOI response the board there was no impact on patient related activity Among other items stolen from Cardiff and Vale were seven laptops in 2007 08 and five baths with fittings worth 2 500 In 2008 09 a 4 000 wheelchair was stolen and last year five hospital beds worth 5 000 in total were taken Several other computers laptops and other smaller items were also taken The health board bore the cost in all cases except the cable thefts where the Welsh Risk Pool effectively an insurance scheme for health bodies covered above an excess of 25 000 Hywel Dda saw a 4 128 Transit van stolen in 2010 along with a Philips X ray machine It said the X ray machine had no monetary value as it was 30 years old and was obsolete Other thefts include eight oxygen cylinders a television worth 499 and a 700 jet washer earlier this year Costs were met by hospital funds and patient care was not affected Cwm Taf did not supply any values but said thefts included an ambulance liaison phone from Llwynypia Hospital a Stihl blower lightning protector strips from buildings a trailer and 50 flag stones stolen from the back of the geriatric day unit at St Tydfil s Hospital It said losses were claimed through insurance and patient care was not affected Abertawe Bro Morgannwg did not supply any values but said there were 255 reported thefts since 2008 mostly patient property but including some IT equipment computers and TV equipment It said it had no information on how the losses were met and said patient care was not affected Betsi Cadwaladr did not supply monetary values but a list of lost or stolen items includes wheelchairs cameras and a sat nav oil stolen from pipes a flat screen TV laptops mobile phones a BM machine oxygen cylinders lead and a wifi system Powys did not supply a list of incidents but said some suspected thefts had occurred It does not keep records of the financial impact and said patients were not affected Aneurin Bevan said thefts included a television computers laptops small amounts of personal cash and stationery items It did not provide values nor details of who met the cost and whether patients were affected Roger Goss co director of Patient Concern said The biggest worry for patients is the disappearance of their medical records via theft because records are increasingly held on computer equipment and are easily nicked Of course hospital security is very difficult given the number of people legitimately on the premises That s a big problem But on the other hand you don t want barriers and armed guards at the entrance", "People with Parkinson s disease have taken to the dance floor to see if Irish set dancing can improve their symptoms It is part of an international study being led by the University of Limerick Results are yet to be analysed but in a previous study patients fell less often and were more mobile after regular set dancing lessons Benefits may be down to exercise the strong rhythm of Irish music and the sociability of group dances The research could potentially lead to people worldwide being offered traditional Irish set dancing as part of their Parkinson s treatment I m very happy that this dance can help people improve their quality of life This is our job Masters student Joanne Shanahan a qualified set dance instructor led an exercise programme twice a week for eight weeks in a pilot study Eight patients with mild to moderate Parkinson s took part and were compared against a control group One of them Mary spoke to the BBC but did not want her surname to be made public She was diagnosed with Parkinson s eight years ago and it causes her to drag her right leg behind her when she walks as well as making her joints stiff With the music it kind of lifted you somehow she said I would walk out better than I walked in Her husband Pat noted that set dancing helped Mary get better at little things like putting her own shoes on Mary has now pledged to join regular set dancing classes I feel this is definitely helping me Mary said I m going to join up and keep it going Lecturer Amanda Clifford said the enjoyment factor of set dancing is key There s theory to support that this is beneficial and we have seen this in some other studies she said But she warned that she and her team are still analysing results from a pilot study Parkinson s research first turned to set dancing after an Italian doctor had a chance encounter in a County Clare village Daniele Volpe is an Irish folk music enthusiast and plays the guitar While playing at an annual traditional music festival in Feakle he saw a man walk in using a cane Dr Volpe recognised the symptoms of Parkinson s but was amazed when the man set aside his cane to start dancing in a fluent way He teamed up with Dublin based researcher Timothy Lynch and on Dr Volpe s return to Venice they sent 24 patients with Parkinson s to weekly set dancing classes for six months When measured against a control group all of them saw improvement in balance mobility and quality of life They found it easier to change direction and to start moving again after they had stopped In 20 years of sending patients to the gym to swimming and to treadmill based rehabilitation he said this was the first time that all the patients gave very high compliance to the treatment Other dance forms including tango ballet and foxtrot have been investigated as possible aids for Parkinson s patients But the steady rhythm of Irish folk music acts as an acoustic cue Dr Volpe said bypassing the Parkinson s trouble spots in the brain and helping patients to overcome their symptoms for the duration of the dance And he is optimistic about people getting the therapy worldwide because everywhere you can listen to traditional Irish music The sociable nature of set dancing and the uniformity of the steps used also prompted improvements in patients symptoms Dr Volpe believes He said I m very happy that this dance can help people improve their quality of life This is our job A larger research study led by the University of Limerick with input from Meg Morris at the University of Melbourne is due to be rolled out in Ireland in the coming months And Parkinson s sufferers from Italy and Ireland will join to perform set dancing at the Feakle festival later this year", "Nick Clegg has denied the government is deceiving the public over measures to address the shortage of midwives in the NHS in England Before the 2010 general election David Cameron promised to increase the number of midwives by 3 000 The government has created 5 000 training places but critics say this has not been translated into jobs Figures compiled by the Royal College of Midwives show the number of jobs has increased by just 145 since 2010 On live radio Mr Clegg was accused by Susie a midwifery student at King s College London of deception We know there s a chronic shortage of midwives in this country and your government keeps saying we re investing in 5 000 more student midwife places she said But wouldn t you say it s true you re largely deceiving the public the taxpayer and us student midwives because trusts don t have the money to employ us Susie told the deputy prime minister on his weekly Call Clegg programme on LBC that there were 45 students training with her but they calculated there were jobs in nearby trusts for only 20 of them Mr Clegg said I don t think we re deceiving anyone What we re saying is we are putting more money into making sure there are more midwives like yourselves who are properly qualified to work in the NHS But he conceded that some NHS trusts did not have enough money to employ more midwives What I totally accept is that different trusts have got different financial pressures he said If you want to work in an area where a trust is under particular financial pressures that s going to feel different to another trust which has managed its affairs well over the years and has actually got money to spend on the things we all want including more midwives The State of Maternity Services report published by the Royal College of Midwives says there were the equivalent of 20 790 full time NHS midwives in England in 2010 In 2012 there were the equivalent of 20 935 full time midwives The College estimates the shortfall in the number of midwives required is still 5 000", "The recent critical report into avoidable deaths at Stafford Hospital has given rise to an outpouring of frustration and anger from doctors nurses and managers who tried to raise concerns about standards in their hospitals Is this a natural response to such a devastating incident or is there a more deep rooted problem at the heart of the NHS Loyalty to the NHS is not simply demonstrated by following instructions or performing a particular set of tasks It is demonstrated by the deeper loyalty to patients and often patient groups This is the very value that makes the health service so loved of course and it actually gives the system an invisible stability because it is a bond shared by staff across the professions In my role I spend a fair amount of time visiting hospitals around the country and you can soon pick up the culture of the organisation In some trusts it is clear that the chief executives and their management team value the input of all the clinical staff and vice versa They work as a team and hence their organisations thrive even in an austere financial climate There is no appetite to really understand and face up to the cracks that are emerging in the service However there is a pernicious style of management that pervades some hospitals and leads to a fractured doctor manager relationship My sense is we are going backwards and collegiate working seems to have deteriorated in the past few years I do not have hard evidence to show that but as a college we hear much more about what Robert Francis QC described in his report which is the prioritisation of business management systems over the delivery of good care It is not just the system in itself nor the targets It is important to keep the waiting lists down both in accident and emergency departments and for the non urgent work We should applaud the fact that the waiting list for some cardiac operations has fallen in recent years from 18 months to four weeks No one would return to the days of patients lying on trolleys for 24 hours in a casualty department But many of the tensions between staff arise when targets around the lists are enforced against a doctor or nurse s better clinical judgement Hospitals have to find a way of allowing the expression of clinical judgment based on what is best for the patient to be the guiding principle These are the experiences of what you might call a coercive environment recounted to me in the past few weeks since the Francis Report was published The NHS now sees many more patients with diseases that come in older age and with less money available so Jeremy Hunt his ministers and the professions now have to find a way of fixing the overworked machine in order to provide good high quality care An open culture devoid of gagging clauses and secrecy will forge much stronger care The Royal College of Surgeons is here to help but we want to see tangible changes coming out of the Francis inquiry and I ll highlight just two of our main recommendations Firstly patients concerns and their experiences must be acted on not ignored We are pleased the government has announced that it will establish a review to look at how trusts currently act on complaints when concerns and issues are raised Separately we believe that the government should also look at improving the representation of patient safety and dignity issues at trust board levels Patients must be put back at the centre of care Secondly we want far clearer standards for organisations and professionals to comply with to improve patient care As a college we set standards for the whole of surgery but we would like to have a greater role in the way in which they are embedded and overseen in the NHS The government needs to involve us in this work so that the public will know that the standards of their care are supported by the best clinical evidence In my profession there exist strong affiliations that attach to the individual surgical specialty that has helped to train and support you throughout your career creating a lifelong allegiance to a code of conduct towards patients and towards members of the team and it exerts a very great influence upon a doctor I don t think that this is always well understood by ministers or senior officials but they ignore it at their peril An open culture devoid of gagging clauses and secrecy and one that enables all the staff to work productively together will forge much stronger care This commitment to the patient and to an ethical code of conduct so sadly lacking in the case of Mid Staffs needs to be respected and nurtured In my view it is the key to rejuvenating the NHS", "A criminal investigation into the death of a diabetic woman at Stafford Hospital in 2007 has been launched the Health and Safety Executive has said Gillian Astbury 66 from Hednesford died after going into a diabetic coma at the scandal hit hospital An inquest in 2010 found the failure to administer insulin amounted to a gross failure to provide basic care The HSE said the decision to launch an investigation was deferred until after a public inquiry A report by the chair Robert Francis QC into a higher than expected number of deaths at the hospital from 2005 to 2009 was published in February Mrs Astbury was admitted to the hospital in April 2007 after a minor fall and was being treated for fractures to her arm and pelvis The inquest in 2010 at Stafford Coroners Court heard Mrs Astbury s blood sugar levels were not properly monitored and insulin was not administered on the day before her death despite being prescribed by doctors The jury returned a narrative verdict and said a failure by nursing staff to record glucose levels communicate effectively and read clinical notes contributed to her death One of the nurses who looked after her told the inquest she was shocked when she first started working at Stafford Hospital Senior staff nurse Patricia King told the hearing It was like going back 20 years coming to this ward She said staff on the ward had to muddle through in poor conditions with no office or nursing station and a shortage of nurses and support workers The HSE confirmed its inspectors had formally started an investigation A spokesman said Our focus will be on establishing whether there is evidence of the employer the Trust or individuals failing to comply with their responsibilities under the Health and Safety at Work Act We reviewed Mrs Astbury s dreadful care and as a result disciplinary action was taken The Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust has renewed its apology to her family Julie Hendry from the trust said Mrs Astbury s death was reported as a serious untoward incident at the time and a full investigation into her care and treatment was carried out The recommendations from that investigation were implemented Actions included raising staff awareness about the care of diabetic patients and improving the information and system for nurse handovers In 2010 we reviewed Mrs Astbury s dreadful care and as a result disciplinary action was taken We will of course co operate fully with the Health and Safety Executive s investigation Campaign group Cure the NHS which has fought for senior figures to be held to account for failings at the hospital welcomed the investigation but noted that it had taken six years In a statement it said Mrs Astbury s death served as a tragic reminder of the appalling care many patients and their families were forced to endure The group said Her death and the failure of the Trust or the West Midlands Strategic Health Authority SHA to properly investigate and ensure action was taken shows why the public inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire Trust was so important A police investigation was launched after her death but the Crown Prosecution Service ruled there was insufficient evidence to bring charges In a statement Staffordshire Police said The matter was also referred to the Health and Safety Executive which has now decided to carry out its own investigation Staffordshire Police and the HSE form part of the multi agency group that is reviewing information brought to light by the Francis Inquiry Report The public inquiry the fifth of its kind into failings at Stafford heard hundreds of patients may have died needlessly after they were routinely neglected Many were left lying in their own urine and excrement for days drank water from vases or given the wrong medication", "School nurses were once seen simply as nit seekers but children s safety and emotional wellbeing are now their primary concern The government has announced that children will help to train school nurses in how to provide the best support as part of a strengthened and more tailored school nursing service Yet there are only 1 200 of them in England and about 20 000 primary and secondary schools So why is their role still so important The poor health of army recruits in the 1890s is thought to have created the need for nurses to look after the health of children and young people In the early 1900s these public health nurses were concerned with hygiene and the spread of disease frequently dealing with outbreaks of flu and cholera The first school nurse worked in Bolton caring for the poor in their own homes and then in the 1960s and 70s school nurses began wearing white coats answering to doctors and brandishing nit combs School nurses are approachable and non judgemental We re in a position to be able to support young people But the Nitty Nora image of school nurses combing through children s hair is one the profession has long been trying to shed The role has always been about promoting public health with children and families says Sharon White professional officer with the School and Public Health Nurses Association SAPHNA which represents school nurses But their work now covers around 50 different facets ranging from acne to sexual exploitation self harm to sleep problems all those issues centred around the holistic health of children Immunising children measuring their height and weight running drop in clinics and teaching part of the PSHE personal social and health education curriculum are just a few more of the jobs they can be asked to do Depending on the needs of the local population school nursing resources have to be focused on some areas more than others They do not work alone either Qualified school nurses are part of a team of health professionals who help share the load Sometimes the school nurse may seem invisible but she is spending time on the neediest complex families and on safeguarding issues says Sharon White And there s a difference between accessibility and invisibility School nurses say they have a unique position working with children aged from five to 19 years They can have one to one conversations with them in a way that teachers often feel unable to do They also offer greater confidentiality and a link between home and school School nurses can play a massive part in public health but there need to be more of them Helen Ross is an executive board member of SAPHNA She started school nursing in 1989 and has seen many changes since then She and her team now spend 70 of their time on trying to protect children which she says is the right thing to do following the cases of Baby P and Victoria Climbie School nurses are approachable and non judgemental We re in a position to be able to support young people and they have a voice we must listen to The Department of Health s new vision for school nursing wants to take this further by making nurses more visible and more relevant It started with a promise last year to make it easier to contact school nurses by texting them to make appointments Now 300 young people will be chosen to help shape the services which school nurses provide Caroline Voogd the editor of the British Journal of School Nursing understands why this is important Visibility has been poor Involving young people ensures that they know the school nurse exists But it is still a small workforce While there were 2 415 registered school nurses in England in 2008 according to the Nursing and Midwifery Council numbers went down to 1 138 in May 2010 then up again a little to 1 216 by the end of 2012 Even if services are as made as efficient as possible Voogd believes there should still be more qualified school nurses You can increase performance and productivity but that only goes so far School nurses can play a massive part in public health but there need to be more of them", "Andrew Marr has returned to the television screens as a guest on his own BBC Sunday morning Andrew Marr Show for the first time since he suffered a serious stroke in January He issued a joking message to the nation warning against rowing machines convinced that his own stroke was caused by over vigorous exercise on one I did the terrible thing of believing what I read in the papers because the newspapers were saying that what we must all do is take very very intensive exercise in short bursts He described what happened next I went onto a rowing machine and gave it everything I had and had a very strange feeling afterwards and then a blinding headache and flashes of light I served up a family meal went to bed and woke up the next morning lying on the floor unable to move What I had done I had torn the carotid artery which takes blood into the brain and had a stroke overnight He still has mobility problems on his left side and describes his walk as a sort of elegant wobble However he is determined to return to work after further months of intensive physiotherapy I ve got a lot of physio still to do Can short bursts of very intensive exercise cause a stroke Nikki Hill deputy director of communication at the Stroke Association said Regular exercise is an important factor in stroke prevention and recovery We have heard anecdotally that some activities like vigorous exercise can sometimes cause blood vessels to burst We need more research on the underlying factors that might make that happen We do know that high blood pressure itself is the single biggest cause of stroke until more research is done on specific triggers we d suggest getting your blood pressure checked Exercise can help with that Is it possible to suffer strokes without realising it as Marr says had happened to him in the previous year NK It is interesting that he mentioned he had two strokes without realising it That may have been a transient ischaemic attack also known as a TIA or mini stroke the symptoms are very similar to stroke but they subside within 24 hours It is essential people know the signs they might have had a TIA because it is a medical emergency and treatment may prevent a full blown stroke The simplest way to know what to look for is the FAST test Facial weakness Arm weakness Speech difficulties Does any exercise increase the risk of a stroke Stroke Association Fact Sheet Regular exercise can halve your risk of a stroke Thirty minutes of activity five days a week can reduce your risk It is just as effective to exercise in small sessions What are the symptoms of stroke The Stroke Association says The FAST test Facial weakness can the person smile has their mouth or eye drooped Arm weakness can the person raise both arms Speech problems can the person speak and understand what you say", "If you want to reduce your risk of having a stroke you might want to cut down on salt But would you think about how much potassium you re eating A series of studies in the BMJ show that reducing salt to 3g a day and increasing potassium rich foods fruit and vegetables are good sources would help to prevent strokes by reducing high blood pressure So should you ditch the crisps and grab a banana instead Potassium is a chemical that is essential for cells to work properly It s particularly important in nerve and muscle cells but it is also essential to help keep the body s fluid balance in a steady state Low levels of potassium in the blood can cause weakness and muscle cramps It is rare to get these problems from eating too little potassium usually they re caused by medical conditions that make us lose potassium through diarrhoea kidney failure or excessive sweating But that s not to say that eating enough wouldn t have benefits Hundreds of years ago we had diets that were rich in potassium and we would consume about 200mmol a day This study suggests that many don t eat the government s recommended 90mmol a day Some countries the USA and Canada included advocate 120mmol a day As the amount of processed food we eat has risen and we consume fewer fruits and vegetables so the amount of potassium we eat has fallen The BMJ research which specifically looked at the effects of potassium on heart disease and stroke suggests that a higher intake of potassium could cut the risk of stroke by 24 This was found by adding up the results from nine observational studies which because they don t involve randomising people to get more or less potassium can only show an association rather than cause and effect The authors also found a small reduction in blood pressure in people who had more potassium Overall the authors conclude that increasing how much potassium we eat could be beneficial But here s the huge health warning people with kidney problems should not increase their intake as they can t get rid of any excess and high levels of potassium can cause abnormal heart rhythms Eating the UK recommended amount was enough to get the health improvements and eating more than 120mmol per day did not show any additional benefits Bananas are the best known high potassium food containing 24mmol but avocados have nearly twice as much Other sources include yoghurt milk nuts broccoli peas red meat chicken and fish So there is no excuse unless you ve been told to restrict your potassium for medical reasons in which case keep doing so BMJ Effect of increased potassium intake on cardiovascular risk factors and

Look There s Cameron Mackintosh And there s lovely Russell Tovey And there s Nancy Dell Olio looking like a pair of Oxford brogues in need of a good polish I ve arrived The thing is I m not precisely sure where I adore grand set piece restaurants Just as every city needs a serious train station full of clocks for snogging couples to meet under so it needs spectacular restaurants Balthazar is certainly that from the faux nicotine stained walls to the station clock and the poised amber hue which makes the whole place look like it s been shot through an Instagram filter It s a restaurant with a Hollywood production designer And it has heat In one of his emails responding to my complaints about not being able to bag a table McNally admitted he was embarrassed by the hotness thing He told me that in 30 years as a restaurateur he d never once had a PR but now did because he s in business with Caring I ve agreed to it so I can t complain about it But I wish I hadn t Especially if this is part of the reason why there s an interest in Balthazar That puts the oh do sod off into disingenuous He never needed a PR before because his New York clientele did the job for him unpaid

recommended that same sex couples in the republic be recognised in law The convention voted 79 in favour of full equality for same sex marriage in Dublin on Sunday Under the Irish constitution any major constitutional change has to be ratified by the electorate The Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the Gay and Lesbian Network welcomed the endorsement of gay marriage equality The Marriage Equality director Moninne Griffith said the vote proved Ireland is ready for equality for same sex couples and wants equal access to civil marriage for loving committed gay and lesbian couples The Gay and Lesbian Network director Brian Sheehan described the vote as a historic day a major milestone on the remarkable journey towards full equality The convention was established by the Fine Gael Labour

the diseases can be spread directly or indirectly from one person to another Quite so Just like Facebook addiction which also spreads from person to person and has now reached pandemic proportions with more than a billion sufferers worldwide The Facebook pathogen doesn t kill people of course for the good reason that dead people don t buy stuff But it does seem to affect victims brains For example it reduces normally articulate and sophisticated people to gibbering in the online equivalent of grunts Likewise it obliges them to coalesce all the varieties of human relationships into a simply binary pair friends v everyone else I have some real friends as opposed to friends on Facebook and every so often one of them posts a comment on something I ve written I ve just looked at one such observation It s thoughtful subtle and nicely written But beneath it is a button simply labelled Like If I click on it my friend will doubtless receive a message from Facebook telling him that I like his comment Big deal What s interesting about this is the way a software system has been designed to strip all of the nuances and complexities that characterise human interaction and compress them into a channel with the bandwidth of Morse code Actually the bandwidth is even more attenuated than that At least with Morse something can be either a dot or a dash but Facebook lacks even that binary sophistication It only has a Like button possibly because a Dislike one might facilitate a higher level of discourse than that deemed desirable by the system s architect Cultural critic Neil Postman once observed that you can t use smoke signals for philosophical discussions the communication channel simply doesn t have the necessary bandwidth One wonders what he would have made of Facebook or of the fact that a sixth of the world s population is apparently satisfied by such a primitive medium of communication Meanwhile the efforts of Facebook s owners to monetise these poor saps continue unabated The basic idea is to use their personal data to refine the targeting of ads at them which means that as time goes on the system becomes more and more tiresome to use This raises the spectre that one day the worms might turn and depart But hey Facebook management has a plan for that too It s revealed in a fascinating patent application just published Like all patent applications it consists of three coats of prime technical verbiage and the devil is in the detail but the essence of it is that in exchange for a monthly payment Facebook users will be able to get rid of ads and specify exactly what should replace them on their personal profiles This is subtly different from what other freemium services like Spotify currently offer You have to admire the chutzpah implicit in this First you bombard your hapless users with ads Then you offer them relief in return for payment There s a word for this in English but m learned friends don t approve of it so I will avoid it I ll be surprised if the patent is approved but the US Patent and Trademark Office has a track record in granting daft patents as for example US Patent 5 443 036 for a method of exercising a cat by getting it to follow a spot generated by a laser pointer so I might be unduly optimistic For fiendish ingenuity however Facebook s latest move into the mobile phone business takes the biscuit Neatly avoiding the trap of getting into the handset manufacturing game the company has instead developed an Android app that really ought to be codenamed Cuckoo because it effectively takes over any handset on which it is installed It can be downloaded for a subset of recent Android handsets and last week HTC unveiled the first phone that comes with Facebook Home pre installed The app conceals the array of apps that normally dominate Android home screens and instead puts Facebook activity squarely in the centre of the phone s screen It splashes status updates across the phone s lock and home screens and makes Facebook s messenger application ubiquitous with little Chat Heads that follow you from app to app thereby making it easy to keep up with what pass for conversations on Facebook What Facebook Home means of course is that Facebook will be the first and perhaps the only thing that new users of smartphones especially in emerging markets ie poor countries see when they fire up their phones And when they want to search for something why they will use Facebook s search engine rather than that of Google the company that created the operating system on which Facebook s app runs Howzat", "The most important thing in life is having a child said the late Prof Sir Robert Edwards He was one of the pioneers of in vitro fertilisation known as IVF alongside his colleague Dr Patrick Steptoe Sir Robert who has died aged 87 was born in Batley outside Leeds in September 1925 World War II and service in the British Army delayed his eventual emergence in the scientific world In 1951 he graduated from the University of Bangor in Wales and then completed his doctorate at the University of Edinburgh in 1955 It was at Edinburgh that he met his wife Ruth Around this time he began to work on the processes of fertilisation that critical moment when a man s sperm and a woman s egg join to create new life Animal studies had shown that it was possible to fertilise an egg in a laboratory instead of inside the body The team of Dr Steptoe and Prof Edwards were trying to achieve the same results in people It took until 1968 for the first glimmers of success They fertilised an egg which then began to develop and reached the blastocyst stage after five to six days Prof Edwards said I ll never forget the day I looked down the microscope and saw something funny in the cultures I looked down the microscope and what I saw was a human blastocyst gazing up at me I thought We ve done it However there would be another decade of trials and tribulations before the first test tube baby Their work was refused funding by the UK s Medical Research Council in 1971 and they had to rely largely on private donations to continue their work It was also vigorously opposed by groups including the Catholic Church and scientists were concerned about abnormalities in any babies born through these procedures There were many failed attempts the first pregnancy was ectopic but one of the childless couples treated were Lesley Brown and her husband John They had been trying to conceive for nine years but now she was pregnant The media storm was intense We were concerned that she would lose the baby the foetus because the press were chasing Mrs Brown all over Bristol where she lived said Prof Edwards in 2008 So secretly Patrick Steptoe hid the mother in his car and drove her to his mother s house in Lincoln the press didn t know where she was In 1978 at Oldham and District General Hospital a tiny baby was introduced to the world The birth of Louise Brown the first test tube baby changed the world forever Being infertile was no longer a guaranteed barrier to having a child Robert Edwards and Patrick Steptoe would then set up the first IVF clinic Bourn Hall in Cambridgeshire in 1980 The opposition to IVF lessened with time and the procedure is now commonplace By 2012 more than five million children had been born through assisted reproductive techniques around the world Dr Patrick Steptoe died in 1988 It was a long wait for a Nobel Prize which was awarded to Prof Edwards for medicine in 2010 A knighthood followed the year later He was one of the giants of science in the 20th Century and pioneered the techniques which have given children to millions of couples", "A 23 year old man has died after collapsing while running in the Brighton

south Wales was down to Department of Health policy in the 1990s are completely incorrect the government has said Vaccination rates fell after Dr Andrew Wakefield s now discredited 1998 study linking the MMR jab and autism In a statement on the Age of Autism website Dr Wakefield said he had called for a single measles vaccine instead of MMR but this was not heeded The government said its advice kept the interests of patients paramount When questions were raised in the wake of Dr Wakefield s research the UK government and the vast majority of scientists insisted that MMR the combined vaccine against measles mumps and rubella was safe Prof David Salisbury Director of Immunisation Children from 15 years ago they re the ones we need to get back and vaccinate A spokesman for the DoH said Dr Andrew Wakefield s claims are completely incorrect He added Measles is a highly infectious and harmful disease If your child has not had two doses of MMR whatever their age we urge you to contact your GP surgery and make an appointment Dr Wakefield s comments came as vaccination clinics aimed at controlling the spread of measles in south Wales are being extended to areas not yet affected by the disease There are fears the outbreak could escalate when children return to school after the Easter holidays and Health Wales is warning that too few children aged 10 to 17 are coming forward for MMR jabs There have so far been 693 cases of measles in and around the Swansea area since November The General Medical Council found Dr Wakefield guilty of serious professional misconduct in 2010 and he was struck off the medical register It did not investigate whether his findings were right or wrong but focused on the way he carried out his research Dr Wakefield s study considered whether there was a link between the three in one MMR vaccine and autism and bowel disease It gives 99 protection against the measles virus One dose is better than none but two doses is better than one If you are concerned about travelling to an outbreak area you can bring forward the second MMR dose Speak to your GP about it The advice is to go to your GP and arrange for them to be immunised as soon as possible before you travel Measles is a dangerous viral illness that can be fatal BBC Health Measles It focused on tests carried out on 12 children who had been referred to hospital for gastrointestinal problems Dr Wakefield was also paid to carry out another study at the same time to find out if parents who claimed their children were damaged by the MMR vaccine had a case Some children were involved in both studies The Lancet medical journal which published Dr Wakefield s findings said it was not informed of this and that together the studies represented a potential conflict of interest which would have led it to reject the paper At a press conference at the Royal Free Hospital when the study was published most of those who were involved in the research agreed that further research was needed and that parents should continue to have their children vaccinated with the three in one jab Dr Wakefield s statement published on the Age of Autism website on Thursday accused officials in the 1990s of putting price before children s health He said the Health Protection Agency had told him use of single measles vaccines would destroy our MMR programme He said he had recommended the use of single measles vaccine at the press conference to launch his Lancet paper on the MMR jab and that remains my position While MMR vaccination uptake fell from February 1998 there was a reciprocal increase in the uptake of the single vaccines he said Six months later in September 1998 the British government withdrew the importation licence for the single vaccines effectively blocking this option for parents Measles cases in the UK rose when the government withdrew the importation licence for the single measles vaccine leaving concerned parents with no choice The Wakefield claims have been tested in over a dozen statistical studies carried out across large populations in different countries and none found any evidence at all to suggest there was any link between the MMR jab and autism These studies included a 2004 investigation by a team from the UK Medical Research Council which compared the vaccination records of 1 294 children diagnosed with autism or related conditions with those of 4 469 children who had no such diagnosis Overall 78 of the children with autism had received MMR But 82 of the other children had also been given MMR A 2005 paper looked at autism rates among 31 426 children born in Japan It found the incidence of autism actually increased after the MMR jab was withdrawn in the country in 1993 One of the biggest studies of all a 2002 paper examining the records of 537 303 children born in Denmark also showed no link between MMR and autism Have you been affected by the measles outbreak Send us your comments using the form

feels this year Twelve months ago my overriding emotion was fear of not finishing of letting people down of the unknown This time round my biggest worry is complacency My training has gone well Last year s ankle injury hasn t flared up I know I can finish But if I start too fast and then hit a wall at mile 16 To be honest I didn t expect to be doing the London Marathon ever again I really enjoyed last year The crowd was fabulous But it was hard And my knee ankle problems were sufficiently bad that I did not run for six months afterwards But time is a great healer The difficult memories fade So when last autumn the two charities I ran for last year Whizz Kidz and Action for Stammering Children asked me to run again I thought What the heck Actually I thought Five hours 31 minutes I can do better than that Nothing like a bit of competitive edge to spur you on And once my shadow cabinet colleague Jim Murphy said in an interview that he could beat my time carrying Ed Balls on my back well the die was cast Of course I know Jim will go quicker than me He s a bit younger and much lighter and probably fitter too As are tens of thousands of others who will go much faster then me too That s the great thing about the marathon it really is the taking part that counts What other sporting event allows world class elite athletes to compete in the same event as middle aged punters like me The power of the London Marathon was brought home last week when we gathered on the green in Westminster to launch my fundraising drive I was joined by some of the children and young peoplewho have been supported by both charities and a group of other runners putting themselves through the pain for these great causes And to my great surprise one of those also running for Whizz Kidz is marathon veteran Iva Barr aged 85 Think about that 85 years old and she will be on the starting line on Sunday to run and walk more than 26 miles for charity Iva is one person who I should really beat in terms

Since then she has left letters in libraries and cafes and even hidden them around the United Nations building You and I don t know one another We may never sit and laugh over cups of coffee We may never dance in the same circles or yawn together by the midnight hour None of that really matters to me It is so small and meaningless to the things I wish you would know on a daily basis that you are

random acts of kindness for givers as well as receivers It might sound a bit like new age nonsense to some people but new research suggests being kind might actually be good for your mental health A study published in the journal Emotion reports that performing acts of kindness may help people with social anxiety to feel more positive Dr Lynn Alden and Dr Jennifer Trew from the University of British Columbia asked volunteers with high levels of social anxiety to commit multiple acts of kindness on two days a week over a four week period Sometimes people would give a small gift to somebody or picking somebody up from work visiting sick people thanking a bus driver They were actually fairly small acts explained Dr Alden They were small acts perhaps but ones which had a much bigger impact More standard treatment for social anxiety disorder is cognitive behavioural therapy CBT adapted specifically for people who fear they will do or say something embarrassing in a social situation As part of this therapy patients are encouraged to face their fears about social contact by putting themselves into a situation they would normally avoid or initiating conversation with new people In Dr Alden s experiment a comparison group of anxious volunteers were asked to perform small belief challenging tasks similar to these therapeutic ones Just like the kind acts group this group were also increasing their levels of social contact engaging in unfamiliar behaviour and paying attention to others responses all things which have been suggested to be important components in overcoming social anxiety At the end of the four weeks participants in the kind acts group avoided social situations less and also reported increased relationship satisfaction Performing kind acts appeared to have a bigger effect than CBT like behaviour tasks A London based initiative called the Kindness Offensive have been organising give away events and encouraging kind acts since 2008 They hold the world record for the largest ever random act of kindness for distributing 39 tonnes of goods in one day It s practically impossible to do an act of kindness without feeling good about yourself said the aptly named David Goodfellow one of the founding members of the group If you can make someone s day a little bit better it will actually make your day a little bit better Dr Nick Grey consultant clinical psychologist and clinic director at the Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma in London was initially wary of the idea that performing kind acts might have therapeutic value for patients with anxiety disorders I hadn t seen the paper and I was sceptical from the title to be honest But it s a good paper and comes from a well respected team I don t think that s ever going to be a therapy in and of itself but it could well be the kind of activity that could be integrated as part of a broader treatment Dr Alden suggests that acts of kindness might be an initial step in a longer therapeutic pathway Engaging in kind acts may help the person to get out and encounter other people and then we can use other techniques to help the person change their beliefs about themselves But she urges caution about performing acts of kindness chosen by someone else or just to impress others I think it has be done in such a way that the individual has a sense of autonomy They are performing the act because they want to and not because it s required by the group", "We love us a bit of fine jewellery and Georg Jensen sure does know his way around a precious metal This sleek

a map of the growing baby s brain UK scientists have embarked on a six year project to map how nerve connections develop in babies brains while still in the womb and after birth By the time a baby takes its first breath many of the key pathways between nerves have already been made And some of these will help determine how a baby thinks or sees the world and may have a role to play in the development of conditions such as autism scientists say But how this rich neural network assembles in the baby before birth is relatively unchartered territory It is very important to be able to scan babies before they are born because we can capture a period when an awful lot is changing inside the brain Researchers from Guy s and St Thomas Hospital King s College London Imperial College and Oxford University aim to produce a dynamic wiring diagram of how the brain grows at a level of detail that they say has been impossible until now They hope that by charting the journeys of bundles of nerves in the final three months of pregnancy doctors will be able to understand more about how they can help in situations when this process goes wrong Prof David Edwards director of the Centre for the Developing Brain who is leading the research says There is a distressing number of children in our society who grow up with problems because of things that happen to them around the time of birth or just before birth It is very important to be able to scan babies before they are born because we can capture a period when an awful lot is changing inside the brain and it is a time when a great many of the things that might be going wrong do seem to be going wrong The study known as the Developing Human Connectome Project hopes to look at more than 1 500 babies studying many aspects of their neurological development By examining the brains of babies while they are still growing in the womb as well as those born prematurely and at full term the scientists will try to define baselines of normal development and investigate how these may be affected by problems around birth And they plan to share their map with the wider research community Central to this project are advanced MRI scanning techniques which the scientists say are able to pick up on details of the growing brain that have been difficult to capture until now While in the womb foetuses are free to somersault in their amniotic sacs and this constant movement has so far hindered clear images of growing brains But researchers at the Centre for the Developing Brain have found ways to counter the effects of these movements building up full three dimensional pictures while the foetus is in motion And by placing the MRI machine in the neonatal intensive care unit at Evelina Children s Hospital in London they are one of the few centres in the world to have a scanner in such close proximity to the babies who often need it most Prof Edwards says This means the same scanning system can be used to find out more about the brains of the sickest and smallest newborn babies he says Daniel Rueckert professor of visual information processing at Imperial College London who is also involved in the research says We are trying to look at brain connectivity in two ways firstly from a structural perspective to find out which parts of the brain are wired to other parts And secondly we are looking at functional connectivity how strongly two brain regions are linked across time and activity But Prof Partha Mitra a neuroscientist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory New York state says we need to be aware of the limitations of the technology in use It would obviously be a very good thing to know more about the circuits in the developing human brain Much of what we know hasn t changed in a hundred years and has come from dissection studies But we need to keep in mind the imaging techniques we have are indirect we can t open up a human brain and look at the connections while someone is alive so we rely on these non invasive methods But there is a big gap between the real circuits in the brain and what images can show us Prof Rueckert acknowledges that this map will provide a macro level view of the developing brain and not be the final answer But he points to early results from the adult version of this project the Human Connectome Project based in the US There is so much evidence already from the adult project that there are significant changes in the brain that can be mapped with the technology we have now It will be incredibly useful to be able to do this with the still growing and developing brain perhaps giving us more time to intervene when things go wrong", "Back in 1969 a book called The Peter Principle was published and became something of a classic in management texts It may have influenced the odd change in the way businesses operated but more memorably it made readers laugh its central premise being that employees are eventually promoted to jobs at which they prove incompetent So the excellent salesman whose naturally charming patter compensated for his administrative weaknesses and won over thousands of customers proves a disastrous sales manager who can t understand why his team of less enchanting but harder working colleagues don t pull off his trick Worse he remains in that job blocking anyone better qualified from doing it properly Now a chap called Tom Schuller is writing a book with a modern twist It is called the Paula Principle and it argues that most women get promoted to a level below their competence Far from rising to a position their talents don t deserve they languish below what they could easily manage The Paula Principle is a clever joke only with a rather serious point It is 45 years since the Ford sewing machinists strike forced changes that led to the 1970 Equal Pay Act ending discrimination in pay between men and women yet in 2013 there is still clear discrimination over who gets the top jobs Last week Lord Davies whose 2011 review on female representation in the boardroom set a target of a quarter of board posts being filled by women by 2015 was forced on to the defensive after evidence showed that progress towards a more equitable gender balance has slowed For the past six months the percentage of female directors appointed to FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 boards has slipped to 26 and 29 respectively according the latest report from the Cranfield International Centre for Women Leaders This is a long way short of the 33 required to reach Davies s target It is also a marked slowdown on rates seen for the preceding six months 44 and 36 for FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies respectively Women now hold 17 3 of FTSE 100 directorships but just 5 8 of executive roles and 21 8 of non executive posts The deceleration in progress may of course be a statistical quirk and certainly business secretary Vince Cable was careful not to use too much alarming language when reviewing the figures But it seems complacent simply to assume this is a one off When the Davies inquiry launched there was much low hanging fruit The worry now is that the easy early gains have been made and further progress will be much harder to achieve especially in terms of getting more women into executive roles That is illustrated by Cranfield s statistics which suggest that there are simply not enough women in the pipeline with the necessary experience to get to the top Its research shows the percentage of women sitting on executive committees the management level one layer below the board has dropped from 18 1 to 15 3 since 2009 There are probably several reasons for that including issues such as flexible working and childcare but it appears that outright discrimination still hampers those who overcome the restrictions The figures also show that just 48 of female executive directors are internally promoted compared with 62 for men This results in ambitious capable women feeling forced to leave their current company or accept the Paula Principle Davies Cable CBI president Roger Carr and equalities minister Maria Miller all spoke on these issues last week and they all seemed to agree that more needs to be done But none of them expressed a clear vision of exactly what which is worrying if this slowdown proves more than a blip It leaves Britain s ambitious businesswomen hoping that those leading the drive for more female directorships have a Plan B and do not prove to be operating a notch or two above their competence level Even by the eurozone s standards regarding its struggling members the deal Cyprus s politicians will now be forced to sell to a wary public looks especially miserly Of the 23bn total cost of the bailout 6bn more than was agreed less than a month ago by the way Cyprus is expected to find 13bn from its own resources That means as well as the privatisations public sector layoffs and tax rises that have become familiar from the Greek case Cyprus will have to sell off a large chunk of its gold reserves and depositors in the collapsed Laiki bank with more than 100 000 in savings are likely to find themselves completely wiped out There are even rumours the bank may not open on Monday morning Yet also in a familiar pattern the calculations on which the rescue is based are still too optimistic the country is expected to bounce back within a couple of years despite a collapsed banking industry Tourism the country s other main business will hardly have been enhanced by coverage of shuttered banks and riots In Dublin this weekend eurozone finance ministers promised Cyprus structural funds to help rebuild its economy But with the banking bust exacerbated by the bungled bailout it s not clear what exactly they are planning to rebuild And despite euro politicians repeated insistence that the island should not be seen as a template for future rescues the raid on bank balances will mean any renewed whiff of crisis in Spain or Italy will send investors fleeing to the safer haven of Germany or out of the eurozone altogether The collateral damage to the whole eurozone banking system may prove far costlier than the bailout Meanwhile hotel and restaurant owners may be looking longingly across at the Turkish occupied half of their island which can offer a cheap lira and no chance of being stopped at the border and forced to hand over your holiday money Pressure to leave the euro can only intensify There has been an absence of morality and of a reckoning in the aftermath of the British banking crash until recent weeks The report into HBOS by the parliamentary commission on banking standards has provided the catharsis adding empirical clarity to a public anger that has raged without a focal point since 2008 The subsequent statement by former chief executive Sir James Crosby is also one of the first genuine acts of atonement to emerge from that era He was not legally obliged to ask for the retraction of his knighthood or give up 30 of his pension but the moral imperative held sway Unlike Fred Goodwin at Royal Bank of Scotland it did not take months of political pressure to make him succumb If the banking industry is to regain public and political trust it needs to mimic Crosby and find a moral conscience", "I have been using herb scented salt for some time most often by chopping dill into the dry salt marinade for making gravlax which I usually do at Christmas and Easter The salt preserves the dill flavours But seasonings like this are too good for special occasion cooking alone Earlier in the week I flavoured a packet of sea salt flakes with lemon and orange zest both finely grated and stirred through the white flakes with a little chopped dill leaf Mixing them with black peppercorns mint leaves and gin I used it as marinade for sea bass Sliced thinly it looked clean and smart against a white plate and needed just a triangle or two of treacle coloured rye bread at its side The second day we served it with a salad of paper thin slices of fennel blood orange and black pepper Flavoured salts are good with grilled meats too and making them is easy You chop the herb leaves thyme rosemary fennel or lavender buds perhaps and mix them one third to two with salt let the mixture dry a little then keep it in a stoppered jar The process becomes even more interesting when you marry a couple of herbs together or introduce a little spice or even garlic Right now my favourite is a salt that has thyme leaves and crushed juniper folded through it In the last couple of weeks its cold Nordic notes have seasoned lamb cutlets from the grill and a sea bream baked whole The salt also had an outing with saut ed potatoes scattered over as they finished cooking Rosemary needles dill fronds fennel thyme savory and celery seeds can be used to add a herbal note to salt But less popular herbs are interesting too Lavender works nicely with grilled chicken I grew myrtle last year a herb that has seen less of the inside of my kitchen than it could Its slight bitterness needs to be tamed It worked well enough in a pork casserole with apples and cider but I like the leaves best when they are pounded with salt use a pestle and mortar then used to bring life to a beef casserole We can crank the herb salt up with other flavourings too Serving grilled chicken skin salty and crisp with a dish of mayo is one of the better ideas I have come across lately but we can take it on a bit By grilling the skin until it crunches then crushing it into a coarse powder and tossing the result with sea salt and a few herbs we have an original and extraordinary seasoning that can be used with both green and root vegetables potatoes and as I do today popcorn Of course you can do the work in a food processor but I prefer to chop the herbs by hand or to mash them with a pestle and mortar Herb flavoured salts will keep in a sealed jar for several weeks though not the chicken skin one below The crucial detail is to let them dry for 24 hours first The most successful way to do this is to scatter the pounded herbs and salt on a tray in a shallow layer and leave it in a warm but airy place Bottle tightly then keep it near the cooker using it as the mood takes you Get your fishmonger to fillet a whole sea bass for you leaving the skin on Serves 4 6 a medium to large sea bass filletedsea salt 8 tbspgolden

large flat dish or platter then spread the salt mixture over with your hands Lay a piece of clingfilm over the fish then place a flat weight such as a chopping board on top Place the fish in the fridge and leave for at least 24 hours Just before serving remove the weight and film and pour off any liquid that may have accumulated around the fish Wipe the fish with kitchen paper removing all

Remove from the oven and place on a piece of kitchen paper to fully crisp You can use the chicken thighs in another recipe Melt 50g of the butter in a pan add the rosemary and cook very briefly until

deep pan Add the popping corn and cover with a lid Over a medium heat cook the corn until it starts to pop shaking the pan vigorously from time to time to ensure it doesn t scorch As soon as all the corn has popped there may be a few stubborn ones that refuse pour in the remaining melted rosemary butter and chicken skin Email Nigel at nigel slater observer co uk", "All around a compound at the Galuh Foundation there are men and women lying on wooden platforms that are doubling up as makeshift beds Many of them have been chained to their beds One man does push ups in the corner his feet tied by iron ropes to the side of his bed Another plays with the links on the chain talking to himself oblivious to the people around him Tucked away in a suburb of Jakarta Galuh is a home for Indonesia s mentally ill It s not easy to find hidden down a dirt road behind a bunch of shacks and a horse shed When you enter it s like walking back into the dark ages leaving modern Indonesia behind The people who work at Galuh say at any given time about 10 of the 280 residents here are shackled but they say it s for their own good I spot Ii in the corner The young man sits quietly with an almost yogic expression of calm on his face Wearing only a pair of shorts he says nothing does nothing just sits He has been shackled in Galuh for two weeks Jaja Sudrajat one of the workers at Galuh told me Ii had only been put in chains temporarily We use these chains just to be careful he told me as he showed me around the foundation We don t use any medication or anything like that so when he s calmed down then we will let him out He was also put in chains in his house and he s been to the psychiatric hospital but he s always escaped so his family brought him here We let them out of these chains every few days or so once they stop being dangerous to themselves and others we let them out But workers at Galuh insist they do not practice shackling known locally as pasung The practice has been banned in Indonesia since 1979 and the Indonesian government launched a campaign in 2011 to eliminate it once and for all We don t practice pasung said Mr Sudradjat If we did then these people wouldn t be able to move altogether But we let them out of these chains every few days or so Once they stop being dangerous to themselves and others we let them out Then we put them back into the chains It all depends on their mood The stench in Galuh is overwhelming a mixture of human urine and faeces As lunch is served one of the workers sprays away the human waste with a hose and inevitably people are hit by the splashes of the dirty water In the middle of the compound there is a giant cage with huge metal grilles The cage is locked Inside there are about 30 or 40 people many of them also chained and without any clothes on It is a depressing disturbing place But it is also a place that is supported by the Indonesian government Galuh gets 10 000 in funding every year from the social welfare ministry but the people who work here say that money covers fewer than half of the patients here The foundation was started in 1994 by a man named Gendu Mulatip who believed in a combination of prayer herbal treatments and chaining people temporarily to cure them He died in 2011 but now his son Suhanda runs the place He boasts of his success rate but can t say specifically how many people he has cured There are a lot of people with a variety of illnesses here Mr Suhanda tells me We treat them with herbal concoctions made of leaves and then we mix it with coconut water It makes them calm Doctors use sleeping pills we use this we don t depend on medication And praise God we ve seen people healed from this and we are happy with the results But we can t say what our success rate is here because people come and go Galuh has been criticised by Indonesia s medical community for not using modern methods to treat its patients We deeply regret these conditions but when I talk to these foundations they think shackling is the best method for their patients Nina Mardiana Galuh s secretary acknowledges there are problems with the foundation but says it needs more help from the government I hope it will be better here in the future she told me None of our workers have any medical training We just diagnose people based on what we think is wrong with them We have told the government that we need some basic medical training so that we can identify the diseases that people here have The BBC approached Indonesia s health ministry to find out why the government is funding an institution that still uses shackling when it has committed to eliminating it Well in the first place it is not the health ministry that funds Galuh that s the social welfare ministry s job said Diah Setia Utami director of mental health at the health ministry Of course we deeply regret these conditions 2014 is our deadline for getting rid of shackling in Indonesia but when I talk to these foundations they think shackling is the best method for their patients And families still send their mentally ill relatives there So it is a very difficult problem to fix For many Indonesians seeing a family member afflicted with a mental disease is frightening and confusing as it is for people around the world But there is relatively far less information about mental illnesses in Indonesia than there may be in other more developed countries Many uneducated Indonesians who live in rural areas believe that these ailments are a result of being the victim of a curse or black magic With little or no education about mental illnesses many resort to the practice of shackling despite the fact that it s been banned for decades But there are some hospitals in Indonesia that are trying to treat the country s mentally ill properly Dr Asmarahadi is one of 14 psychiatrists at the government run Suharto Heerdjan hospital Our culture is to blame people come to the mental hospital as the last resort The ministry of health says there are about 800 trained psychiatrists in the country and 34 dedicated mental health institutions in Indonesia Dr Asmarahadi says its not just that there aren t enough hospitals or doctors it s also the stigma attached to mentally ill patients that makes it so challenging to treat the disease Trained psychiatrists like me are losing out to the witch doctors and spiritual teachers he told me We need to get the message out to people that mentally ill patients can be treated with medication and can live normal lives People think that with medication they will turn into shells of themselves and not be able to have sexual relations with their partners That s not true Dr Asmaharadi admits that the problem isn t one Indonesia can solve overnight It s very challenging he said Most of the people that come here have generalised anxiety problems or schizophrenia We can cure them with medication But by the time they come here for many of them it s too late Our culture is to blame people come to the mental hospital as the last resort after they have spent all their money on witchdoctors shamans and faith based healing centres Faith alone cannot help the likes of the people at Galuh Stripped of their dignity they re locked up and caged like animals Experts say between 1 and 5 of Indonesia s 240 million population is struggling with a mental illness and that s just the figure from recorded cases There could be many more out there but because of a lack of data there s just no way of telling Indonesia says stamping out shackling is a priority but admits it will miss its 2014 target That s little comfort for the country s mentally ill whose ranks are growing year by year", "At the medieval heart of Amsterdam is the Oude Kerk The church founded in 1213 is the city s oldest building a stripped back Calvinist beauty with pearly light pouring through its tall windows over its gilded carvings and across its stone flagged floors It is the kind of serene interior captured in the luminous oils of the Dutch Masters Outside the activities are rather less sacred The Oude Kerk is at the centre of Europe s largest red light district the Wallen and is ringed by hot pink shopfronts where sex workers tap the windows to attract any likely passing trade Opposite the church door is one of dozens of cannabis caf s where you can spark up a joint of Lemon Haze and waste the day away For decades such scenes have been regarded as examples of civilised Dutch tolerance a whatever blows your hair back attitude but Amsterdam has had enough The municipality says its tolerance is being abused as the centre is being overwhelmed by tawdry sex shows drug dealing and British stag party weekenders Organised crime has moved in and many businesses are fronts for money laundering and human trafficking So the city is rebranding itself and has invested upwards of 700m on remaking its cultural institutions over the past decade The Van Gogh museum has been renovated and reopens in May the National Maritime Museum has been made ship shape and the new EYE Film Institute Netherlands has opened in a futuristic building in the Overhoeks neighbourhood The Stedelijk Museum of contemporary art meanwhile has been treated to a bath like extension the size of a city block Crowning these efforts the Rijksmuseum the Dutch answer to the Louvre reopened to the public this weekend after a decade long closure Under a 375m rebuilding project led by the Spanish architects Cruz y Ortiz the museum s two halves have been united by an undercroft that joins its two courtyards The remodelling has been so extensive that only Rembrandt s Night Watch remains in its original location among 8 000 objects in its 80 rooms The central Gallery of Honour containing works by Vermeer and Pieter de Hooch has had a century of whitewash removed and its original late 19th century frescos restored and reinstated Elsewhere canvases are displayed alongside furniture of the same period white marble busts illuminated dramatically against dark charcoal walls In the special collections section small items have been gathered to form art installations a wall of intricate metal keys for example is displayed opposite a vitrine full of locked boxes an entire fleet of miniature wooden ships sails alongside a row of model lighthouses Meanwhile Project 1012 named after the red light district s postcode aims to clean up the neighbourhood The initiative began in 2007 and plans the closure of 200 out of 480 window brothels and 26 out of 76 cannabis coffee houses there are also plans to turn the sleazy Damrak the main street into town from Centraal railway station into a red carpet of welcome to the city with upmarket shopping fashion and cuisine Right wing politicians called for tourists to be banned entirely from the coffee shops a step too far for the municipality of Amsterdam which has just won an exemption to the weed law But it has negotiated a 25m deal to buy 18 brothels and gambling dens from their owners and put them to new uses following the 2008 experiments Red Light Fashion and Red Light Design in which young Dutch designers were allowed to live and work rent free for a year in former brothels and use their windows for showcases Since then a former gambling house has been transformed into the Mata Hari bar and a micro brewery deli florist and homewares stores have also opened nearby The poster project for Project 1012 is Anna a fine dining restaurant carved out of an old gallery and printworks by former club owner Michiel Kleiss You don t need much critical mass around here Kleiss tells me If you are doing something classy it immediately works The Oude Kerk has been known as Amsterdam s living room throughout its history and these days it is also used as a concert hall and exhibition space as part of its restoration Across the square Orpheu de Jong runs Red Light Radio and has a recording studio in the window A few doors down his sister Afaina a former architect has opened the Ultra de la Rue gallery Both were brought up only a few minutes from the red light district but say they didn t set foot in it until they were adults It s a good thing for the area says Afaina but both she and Orpheu are wary of the area losing its edge entirely Stand in front of the Rijksmuseum s charcoal painted walls and look again at those Golden

completed an online survey for the research Of the 33 who went through a crisis bereavement was the most common trigger followed by personal illness or injury Oliver Robinson told the British Psychological Society conference that people became aware of their frailty As well as carrying out the poll the researchers from the universities of Greenwich and Sussex interviewed 20 people who completed the poll It showed that those who reported a crisis had all experienced two or more stressful events that had usually affected their health or someone else s making them more aware of frailty and mortality But a person s response to their experiences appeared to be determined by how they had viewed life One in five said their views on life were unchanged but one in three appeared to be heading in a downward spiral avoiding making plans to avoid being disappointed A person s capacity to cope in their sixties is overwhelmed TJ a more positive respondent said I have another 20 odd years yet and I fully intend to live it not just exist But EM said How much more can you take How much more do you need to take It s coming to terms I think with the reality of what life is now And it s hard Those who felt negative often reported becoming withdrawn and increasingly isolated Dr Robinson who is based at the University of Greenwich said The findings suggest that the 60 69 decade is a key time for developmental crisis No one has looked at this before It seemed an omission For the vast majority it s a good decade But for a considerable minority up to a third it is not People realise that they can t carry on as before He said that the reasons behind these later life crises differed from the more recognised midlife crisis where people are more concerned with where they have got to in life and often about their finances It seems that when loss inducing events occur together or in close proximity in time a person s capacity to cope in their sixties is overwhelmed and a later life crisis is precipitated By better understanding such crisis episodes psychologists are well placed to understand mental health problems in this age group which may well be affected by the events of a crisis", "The measles epidemic in Swansea cannot be blamed on a local newspaper s coverage of concerns about the MMR jab in the 1990s its former editor claims The South Wales Evening Post reported on worries parents had following a now discredited report which linked the vaccine to autism Many experts blamed the research and media coverage of it for a drop in vaccinations resulting in an outbreak But George Edwards said the paper never told parents not to get the jab Nearly 700 people have been diagnosed with measles since the outbreak started in November mainly affecting the Swansea area Health experts have said the epidemic is a result of a 10 to 15 year legacy of concern about the MMR measles mumps rubella jab Newspapers listen to their readers report what they say and then they go to the relevant people and say what have you got to say about this It followed research by Dr Andrew Wakefield in the late 1990s which linked the vaccine with autism and bowel disease His report which was published in The Lancet medical journal was later discredited with health officials insisting the vaccine was completely safe Dr Marion Lyons director of health protection at Public Health Wales PHW said at one stage 45 of children in the Swansea area had not been vaccinated against measles That figure had since fallen to 10 15 but it is still considered too low to stop the spread of the highly infectious disease But Mr Edwards who was editor of the Evening Post at the time of the MMR scare said the newspaper was not responsible for the low uptake of the vaccine As I saw it their the readers concerns were totally genuine he told BBC current affairs series The Wales Report What were we supposed to do Tell them to go away That isn t what newspapers do Newspapers listen to their readers report what they say and then they go to the relevant people and say what have you got to say about this And then they publish that response He added It s impossible to have regrets I m certain that if we wound the clock back and started again I can t imagine any reason why we wouldn t do it the same way What I do need to emphasise is that at no time did the newspaper ever say to parents do not let your children have this jab We never ever said that Although the epidemic is centred around Swansea cases continue to be reported across Wales Most are in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg health region which also includes Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend There are also cases in Powys and in the Hywel Dda Health Board area which covers Carmarthenshire Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire There were six deaths in France in 2011 and five of those were teenagers If we don t vaccinate our children it will happen Concerns have been raised that the outbreak could spread significantly across Wales Dr Lyons told The Wales Report that about 70 000 children across Wales have not had both the necessary MMR jabs Across Wales if you re looking at children who should ve had at least one jab children aged between two and 18 there s 40 000 If you were to look at children aged between five and 18 who should have had two doses it s another 30 000 so that s about 70 000 children who haven t had the dose She said she was concerned that children would be at increased risk when they return to school this week following the Easter holiday Dr Lyons also warned that a death was inevitable if parents did not take action to vaccinate children against the measles epidemic She told the programme There were six deaths in France in 2011 and five of those were teenagers If we don t vaccinate our children it will happen PHW has said it is particularly concerned about the uptake of the MMR jab among children aged between 10 and 17 who would have been babies during the vaccination scare As a result secondary schools in Swansea and Neath Port Talbot will be holding vaccination sessions this week Around 2 500 people also turned up at special drop in vaccination clinics that were held at hospitals across south Wales on Saturday Typical symptoms of measles include fever cough conjunctivitis and a rash Complications are quite common even in healthy people and about 20 of reported measles cases experience one or more complication These can include ear infections vomiting and diarrhoea pneumonia meningitis and serious eye disorders", "Interpreting mortality data in the NHS is a tricky business The health service is damned if it doesn t act quickly enough as was the case with Stafford Hospital and then damned if it does as has happened with child heart surgery in Leeds The problem is that compiling and interpreting the data is not an exact science A high death rate could be said to be a smoke alarm a sign that something may be wrong and therefore needs looking into But just as a smoke alarm can be set off for a rather innocuous reason the smoke from frying food for example so a high death rate can be accrued for perfectly justifiable reasons Mortality figures are risk adjusted which means they take into account factors that could increase the likelihood of death but even so their accuracy does depend on all the data being submitted properly If we have got good data I would say a high mortality rates is nearly always a sign of something not being quite right There are over 300 different variables that hospitals need to provide coving issues such as age time of diagnosis deprivation lifestyle and existing illnesses It is not unheard of for data to be submitted incorrectly or not at all In the case of Leeds General Infirmary which had its child heart surgery halted just before Easter amid concern about high death rates only for the suspension to be lifted this week crucial details were missing which appear to have skewed the overall picture NHS medical director Sir Bruce Keogh explains In order to take case mix into account so that we compare apples with apples and oranges with oranges one of the simple things you need is the weight of a baby But weight was missing in 35 of the cases so that data was very poor quality So does that mean they should not be trusted No according to Prof Brian Jarman one of the UK s leading experts on mortality data He believes the NHS is getting better and better at using and understanding the data There are now several different ways of compiling data Dr Foster the research group he works for looks at four key measures deaths in hospital deaths within 30 days of discharge deaths after surgery and deaths among patients in low risk conditions It allows them to cross reference hospitals with high rates in one area with data from another For example according to latest figures there were more than 50 cases where a trust had higher than expected death rates on one measure But Dr Foster was able to narrow that group down to 12 by looking for those trusts with high rates in two categories Prof Jarman says It really does depend on us getting good quality data That is why we say mortality rates are not perfect they are a sign that something may be wrong and should definitely not be ignored If we have got good data I would say a high mortality rates is nearly always a sign of something not being quite right", "One of the first purchases I ever made on eBay was a scratch n sniff card It was an old promo thing for John Waters s 1981 film Polyester they were

the size of cats pretending they re people And I think about it often because I read that having built this candy cathedral they realised it didn t quite work because all M Ms bags are sealed The place smelled of nothing So they commissioned a chocolate scent which they spray through the vents There are too many painful metaphors here To write them down would be to admit defeat We ve always

increased intent to purchase by 80 and now the smells are following customers home One of Katy Perry s albums was infused with the smell of candyfloss and two PlayStation games were perfumed with the scents of turf and burning rubber So Google s April Fool a search engine for smell called Google Nose felt eerily real a hoax from the very very near future At the moment computers can do everything apart from touch and smell But that s changing In the next five years the concept of cognitive computing means they will experience the world as a human does And not only will they be able to smell but they will smell New Scientist reports on a smelling screen being developed in Japan that makes smells appear to come from any LCD screen by continuously feeding odours from vaporising gel pellets into four air streams one in each corner This means an advert for KFC will smell of chicken An advert for Towie will smell of biscuity tans Like living with 1 000 postprandial dads our front rooms

is something sort of beautiful about marketers decorating their shops with aromas and yet the idea I can be affected by them in a way that will make me feel even more than I feel already is terrifying I care about smell Partly because of my migraines partly my elegant sensibility We think of smells as good or bad but it s more complicated than that it s to do with emotions memory unlike with sight you feel a smell before you process it But it s inevitable Not just because every clank of technology will create new ways to sell to us but because after years of manipulating scents for our own ends
