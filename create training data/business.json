["Police have carried out a series of raids relating to the purchase of Rangers Football Club by Craig Whyte from Sir David Murray Police Scotland said they had carried out a number of searches at addresses in both Scotland and England The statement said These searches related to both domestic and business premises This remains an ongoing investigation and no further information can be provided at this stage A spokesman for Mr Whyte who bought the club from former owner Sir David Murray said Mr Whyte was in Monaco and was puzzled over today s raids adding that he had no idea what they related to The spokesman also said Mr Whyte had consistently offered to speak to the police about their investigation even as recently as this week and that they have declined Mr Whyte purchased Rangers in May 2011 for 1 taking over Sir David s controlling 85 share holding Rangers were subsequently forced into administration then liquidation over non payment of VAT and National Insurance totalling about 14m The court appointed administrators Duff and Phelps passed information to the police after a preliminary examination of the company accounts It emerged that Mr Whyte was able to fund his takeover by selling future season tickets to Ticketus leaving the investment firm a key player as administrators searched for new owners Ticketus won a High Court challenge to force the businessman to repay 18m plus interest and court costs Former Rangers chairman Alastair Johnston also asked the Crown Office to investigate the take over shortly after the club were placed in administration in February 2012 There is also a separate police investigation into alleged leaks of confidential information relating to oldco Rangers long running tax dispute with HMRC Rangers won the so called Big Tax Case last year HMRC said they will appeal The club has been taken over by a new company after the assets were sold to a consortium run by Charles Green", "Portugal and Ireland are to be granted an extra seven years to pay back their emergency bailout loans The European Union and the IMF bailed out the Republic of Ireland in 2010 and Portugal in 2011 The 17 member group that uses the euro currency agreed to the terms at a meeting of finance ministers in Dublin Meanwhile the ministers also said a 10bn euro 13bn 8 5bn EU bailout loan for Cyprus was ready for approval by member states That could happen by the end of the month and if the IMF also gives the go ahead the first bailout money could be released by mid May The plan for Ireland and Portugal is intended to give the countries financial systems more time to recover from the debt crisis after their bailout loans run out There was progress The Eurogroup members have given their stamp of approval to the economic policies Cyprus has agreed with the three agencies know as the Troika The programme now needs to go through the procedures that each Eurozone country requires That much is clear But the scale of the Cypriot contribution to sorting out its own banking problems is anything but The media me included have been reporting on the basis of leaked documents that the sums that Cyprus would have to find itself have almost doubled to 13bn euros The European Economics Commissioner Olli Rehn accused us of a veritable fruit salad of misrepresentation People have been comparing apples with pears and coming up with oranges Still the Cypriot President thinks he needs more help from the rest of Europe although not formally through this bailout agreement Ireland s bailout money will run out later this year and Portugal s will run out in 2014 The Irish and Portuguese repayment extensions are expected to be backed by all 27 European Union members which includes those outside the eurozone later on Friday Eurogroup President and Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said the ministers in Dublin had commended Portugal on its success in implementing the bailout programme but asked them to maintain the reform momentum despite the difficult economic and domestic conditions He added Ireland is a living example that adjustment programmes do work provided there is a strong ownership and genuine commitment to reforms The BBC s Matthew Price said that the deal could be seen as something of a reward for good behaviour but also as recognition that an austerity first approach was not always the best option The extension is especially important for Portugal When it received a 78bn euro bailout two years ago it pledged to take various measures in its budget to reduce public spending However last week the country s Constitutional Court ruled that several of these measures in the 2013 budget were unlawful If Portugal was to drop the measures because of this it may not remain eligible for more funds under its bailout On Thursday it emerged that Cyprus would need to raise an extra 6bn euros to secure the 10bn euro bailout from Brussels and the IMF The BBC s Matthew Price says Ireland and Portugal could be seen as getting a reward for good behaviour While confirming that up to 10bn euros in loans will be provided to Cyprus the eurozone finance ministers also rejected reports that the country might be granted more financial assistance Presidential spokesman Christos Stylianides said the country was not looking for more money under the bailout programme but was hoping for support through other European support mechanisms What the president of the republic of Cyprus is discussing with European officials is the possibility of increasing European funds for growth and social cohesion Cyprus will ask for the money under the EU s multi annual financial framework designed for member states suffering serious consequences from the euro crisis A draft document prepared by the country s creditors said the cost of the rescue had risen to 23bn euros from 17 5bn euros with Cyprus now having to find 13bn euros of this Mr Anastasiades said he had spoken to EU Economy and Euro Commissioner Olli Rehn and said he would also be writing to European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso and to EU President Herman Van Rompuy The letter to Mr Barroso and Mr Rompuy will refer to the need for EU policy to change towards Cyprus by giving it extra assistance given the critical times we are going through as a result of the economic crisis and the measures imposed on us Mr Anastasiades said Meanwhile the German government said that the size of the eurozone bailout for Cyprus would not rise The contribution from international creditors will not change said German government spokesman Steffen Seibert noting that 10bn euro package was already very large Privately European officials are very anxious they are uncertain where growth will emerge from It is expected that Cyprus will sell much of its gold reserves to help fund its side of the bailout Also bank depositors with more than 100 000 euros in savings will bear part of the cost of the rescue The bank sector on which much of the Cypriot economy was dependent is shrinking and thousands of jobs are being lost Laiki Bank is being wound up and its healthy assets transferred to the Bank of Cyprus Eurozone officials meeting in Dublin also reviewed Slovenia s growing problems There will be no discussion at the meeting of finance ministers and the country will not make an application for bailout funds But the country s prime minister Alenka Bratusek said on Friday that her government will have a plan that should stave off the need for a bailout ready to put to the country s parliament within two weeks The plan is expected to include the selling off of state assets probably including a bank Slovenia which adopted the euro single currency in 2007 has been forced to recapitalise its main banks and the economy is struggling", "Until the late 1970s the Square Mile was a genteel all male club dominated by pinstripe suits public school accents and a culture of long lunches Money was made at the Stock Exchange with effortless panache as a coterie of licensed dealers acted on behalf of stockbroker firms with redolent names such as Quilter and Co The Big Bang blew the ancien regime apart Within six months of Margaret Thatcher s election exchange controls were lifted and foreign capital flooded into Britain The deregulation of the Stock Exchange in 1986 was an invitation to the world s biggest beasts to enter the trading floor Traders began to send huge amounts of money fizzing around the world s financial networks The towers of Canary Wharf rose silver and immaculate from the industrial desert of the former London Docklands The capital began its journey to world financial domination The crash of five years ago cast a shadow on the free for all spirit that the Big Bang let rip But Thatcher s deregulatory push created the new internationally focused City For better and for worse it hasn t looked back At the start of this decade the financial sector was estimated to be worth 125 4bn or 9 4 in gross value to the UK economy As part of a famous television ad campaign from September 1986 an ordinary looking bloke is shown in a fictional village pub Lost in thought he almost knocks a passing postman from his bike It turns out he is preoccupied with the news that he can buy shares in British Gas After passing on the good news to the postie he adds If you see Sid tell him The age of Sid was not simply a PR myth Initially there really was a popular scramble by ordinary folk to sign up to the people s capitalism and reap the rewards Four million people applied for British Gas shares at 135p a pop with a minimum purchase of 100 Many then sold them almost immediately for a quick profit In Thatcher s second term Jaguar British Telecom BritOil and British Aerospace were also sold off Later British Steel British Airways BP water and electricity would follow Thatcher said that privatisation was a chance to give power back to the people In fact as Robert Philpot director of the Progress pressure group wrote last week Now in 2012 it s clear that the result of electricity privatisation was to take power away from the people Small British shareholders have no influence over the overwhelmingly non British owners of the firms that generate and distribute power in Britain Saatchi and Saatchi s Labour isn t working political poster apparently featuring a long dole queue made up of actors became perhaps the most famous in the nation s history British electioneering was changed for ever When Britain s first female prime minister was in her pomp northern football fans travelling to away games in London would be taunted by home supporters waving wads of 10 and 20 notes The brutal repartee of the terraces expressed a fundamental truth of the Thatcher period the north suffered the worst of the deep recession and high unemployment of the early years and it benefited least from the eventual boom of the late 1980s It would be wrong to say that Thatcher planned the decline of the north s most vital industries and sources of employment In fact northern England suffered precisely from the absence of a plan in Westminster In 1985 explaining why she believed regional planning in Britain was a non starter Thatcher said If we try to discourage development and economic growth in large parts of the south of England in the hope that it will happen in the large cities in the north we risk losing them altogether Left to its own devices the British economy rebalanced irrevocably to the south Employment in the manufacturing industry vital to the north s wellbeing slumped falling from 7 1 million in 1979 to 4 4m in 1993 Services and the booming City eventually took up much of the economic slack but the good times were happening in the south Thatcher came to power ready to take on the the National Union of Mineworkers which had humiliated her Tory predecessor Edward Heath during the 1970s The miners strike of 1984 85 allowed her to destroy the power of the NUM and institute a series of legal obstacles to industrial action which she believed had bedevilled Britain in the 70s Meanwhile the decline in Britain s manufacturing industry which Thatcher s government did little to reverse destroyed the power bases of British trades unionism High unemployment and recession critically weakened the unions bargaining power in the early to mid 1980s Since 1980 union membership in Britain has halved A backlash by the Christian right meant that Thatcher s shops bill designed to allow Sunday trading was voted down in 1986 It was her only defeat on an entire bill in the Commons But the road to deregulation for shops and pubs had begun After the second world war British politics seemed to have come to a lasting settlement on the fundamentals of running the country Both the Conservatives and Labour cherished the mixed economy balanced between public and private ownership Pragmatism was the order of the day as union leaders such as Jack Jones and Joe Gormley enjoyed beer and sandwiches at No 10 Economic policy was forged through achieving tripartite consensus between employers unions and the government of the day The winter of discontent sounded the knell for that way of doing things Thatcher arrived in power armed with the free market philosophy of Ronald Reagan s adviser Milton Friedman Managers must be allowed to manage became the mantra and a new style of politics was born The rise of the City of London and its new money focused ethos spawned its own style Designer labels came of age suited to the new aspirational spirit Actresses such as Joan Collins a Thatcher admirer in the American glamour soaps Dallas and Dynasty patented the look for would be female power dressers Shoulder pads and sharply tailored suits ruled Thatcher swore by her blue skirt suit pearls and Asprey handbag a look that was to influence powerful women from Hillary Clinton to Condoleezza Rice Among republicans in Northern Ireland Thatcher is loathed for her intransigence during the Maze prison hunger strike of 1981 which led to the death of Bobby Sands But four years later she appalled unionists by signing the Anglo Irish agreement which gave the Republic of Ireland a say in the affairs of the north paving the way for the Good Friday peace agreement of 1998 Thatcher s education secretary from 1986 89 Kenneth Baker transformed the state school system creating a proto market that is being enthusiastically embraced and developed by one of his successors Michael Gove Baker insisted that attainment levels be made public allowing a league table of schools to emerge At the same time he instructed schools to accept all applicants local or otherwise unless already full The choice agenda was born parents could in theory if not always in practice decide which school their child would go to Local authority control of education was also much reduced by the Education Act of 1988 which gave autonomy over budgets and appointments to heads and school governors Gove has deepened that autonomy with his academy programme and added the further option of free schools Thatcher had no interest in football despite occasional cringeworthy photo ops such as the pose outside No 10 with footballers Kevin Keegan and Emlyn Hughes before the 1980 European Championships But when one of the worst incidents of football hooliganism broke out at a Luton Millwall match in March 1985 she acted The Football Spectators Act was passed in 1989 controversially making ID cards compulsory for fans After the Hillsborough disaster that year in which 96 Liverpool fans died the plan was never acted upon Lord Taylor s Hillsborough inquiry recommended all seater stadiums in English grounds A revolution in who watched football and how they watched it was under way When the European Economic Community began to develop far beyond a free trade agreement Thatcher s strident opposition to anything beyond a single market became a hallmark of her premiership She inspired a generation of Eurosceptics and changed the chemistry of the Tory party In much of the nation fed on a diet of Up yours Delors style headlines and expos s of life aboard the Brussels gravy train the mood gradually shifted from one of relative indifference to antipathy towards the EU Murdoch s Sun switched from backing Labour to the Tories for the 1979 election that launched Thatcher The relationship became mutually beneficial from then on as she helped him create a power base that would be threatened only 30 years later during the hacking inquiry In the early 1980s Murdoch launched a bid for the Times Group newspapers which ordinarily would have been referred to the competition authorities given his existing media holdings Instead the deal went through on the nod after private meetings between Thatcher and Murdoch at Chequers Murdoch would later revolutionise the British media defying the print unions and moving his News International media group to Wapping in an overnight coup de theatre Thatcher backed him According to cabinet minister Norman Fowler any misgivings from colleagues or supporters would be met with the response Why are you so opposed to Rupert He is going to get us in Britain was not always a country obsessed with house prices But the Housing Act of 1980 which allowed council house tenants to buy their own homes changed the face of home ownership in Britain Many former local authority tenants paid less than 10 000 for homes that would be worth 10 times that a decade later Over the next 30 years this radical move towards a nation of home owners led to a trail of unintended consequences A prolonged boom in house prices took place along with a chronic shortage of affordable housing yet to be resolved by a series of governments and the gradual emergence of a culture of debt incurred on the presumption that the value of property would keep rising In the private sector rents soared In the first half of 1988 alone house prices rose by 30 On the back of the housing boom much of Britain mortgaged itself up to the hilt and household debt reached record levels Winning the Falklands war in 1982 transformed Thatcher s standing in the opinion polls Fighting it put the armed forces back on the centre stage for the first time since Suez The Falklands revived the prestige of soldiering as huge crowds gathered to wave off and welcome home the troops in Portsmouth Later came the Gulf Kosovo Afghanistan and Iraq and the tributes to the fallen at Wootton Bassett No one talks about abolishing private schools any more Unilateral nuclear disarmament is not embraced by any of the three main political parties In 1979 as Thatcher took power the top rate of income tax was 83 The ferocious battle this year over lowering the top rate of tax from 50 to 45 illustrates how far the debate on tax has shifted Losing three times to Thatcher led directly to the creation of New Labour and the emergence of Tony Blair as a leader who embraced her emphasis on choice competition and an expanding role for the private sector in the economy Following the crash of 2007 Labour under Ed Miliband has still to decide whether to make the break from that consensus The observation that the Church of England amounts to the Tory party at prayer is thought to date to the 18th century Thatcher s terms of office severely damaged that relationship possibly beyond repair The publication in 1985 of the C of E report Faith in the City A Call to Action by Church and Nation caused an almighty political row between the church and the Conservative party which has reverberated to the present day Endorsed by Dr Robert Runcie then archbishop of Canterbury the document followed riots in Britain s inner cities It was a cry of anguish over the dilapidated alienated state of the inner cities after years of recession gloom and rising unemployment Relations between the Tories and the established church have never truly recovered Thatcher saw the BBC licence fee as a tax imposed on television viewers irrespective of whether they wanted to watch BBC programmes or not As prime minister she believed that a leftwing bias permeated its coverage During the Falklands war rightwingers renamed the corporation the Stateless Persons Broadcasting Corporation a dig at its refusal to describe British troops as our troops and Argentinian soldiers as the enemy It was hoped that the 1990 Broadcasting Act would tame the institution forcing it to outsource at least 25 of its production and allowing new players into the market But the legacy of the Thatcher era has been to drag the BBC into a perpetual culture war And she helped create Channel 4 in 1982 probably not anticipating that it would popularise fiercely anti establishment output Defeat in the Falklands war signalled the end of the road for Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri Castelli head of Argentina s last military dictatorship Thatcher s friendship with Mikhail Gorbachev helped hasten the cold war to its end as the economically moribund Soviet Union collapsed However her refusal to back sanctions on apartheid South Africa

expected to report on Tuesday will fall short of the 2 11bn Goldman made in the first three months of last year The keenly awaited set of results from Wall Street banks which began with JP Morgan last Friday are likely to underline the challenges they still face as they try to encourage chief executives to do more of the mergers and acquisitions that generate lucrative advisory fees for bankers Goldman s investment banking revenues for the first quarter will be 6pc lower than the final three months of last year according to analysts at Credit Suisse Across the whole industry the volume of completed deals was down 17pc in the first quarter compared with the final quarter of 2012 Absent a flurry of transactions in mid February merger and acquisition activity has had a muted start to the year said Howard Chen an analyst at Credit Suisse The lacklustre state of investment banking will be a concern to the industry given many of the conditions required for deals low interest rates and buoyant stock markets were firmly in place during the quarter JP Morgan reports record profits of 6 5bn Time to try a new bank RBS Japan boss quits over Libor manipulation Winklevoss twins back bitcoin as bubble bursts Bitcoin trading halted after panic sell off Goldman chief is world s best paid banker The S P 500 climbed 10pc the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 11 3pc and the FTSE 100 gained 8 7pc However the robust performance from equity markets is expected to have helped other parts of Goldman s businesses Revenues at its lending and investing division climbed to 1 66bn in the quarter from 1 1bn according to analysts at Barclays as rising stock markets lifted the value of its investments Lloyd Blankfein Goldman Sachs s chief executive who this month resisted calls from some shareholders to give up the role of chairman has insisted that the bank s profits will improve consistently once the global economic recovery gathers pace However with many of the financial regulations introduced since the financial crisis yet to be finished some analysts remain sceptical that the backdrop for banks will radically improve this year The revenues from Goldman s bond and commodities business an important source of profits is forecast to have dropped 9pc to 3 3bn in the first quarter compared with the same period last year when the European Central Bank s efforts to stabilise Europe s debt crisis triggered a wave of risk taking from investors Fixed income trading revenues are unlikely to impress investors and a global investment banking rebound that should occur in an economic recovery remains a hope for the future given the euro s continuing problems said Brad Hintz an analyst at Sanford Bernstein", "It looks like you re writing an article Would you like help The words conjour up a mental image of one of the most divisive individuals in software Clippy was the office assistant introduced into Microsoft s Office suite in 1997 The hopeful little wire character provoked an almost universal outpouring of hatred from users The company bowed to the inevitable in 2003 and sent Clippy to the great paper clip tidy in the sky But despite the loathing felt for the feature it had little effect on the seemingly unstoppable march of Office into homes and businesses globally Today one in seven us one billion people use Office whether at work or at home It s a 24bn business which accounts for a third of Microsoft s revenue The man in charge is Kurt DelBene and it s a challenge he obviously relishes You don t have a job like mine or the people of my team unless you get excited everyday about envisioning what the future looks like for people and how they express themselves he says Office has been around since 1989 and was originally composed of Word spreadsheet application Excel and the progenitor of a million Thursday afternoon office presentations PowerPoint It has since expanded to include email client Outlook OneNote for note taking unified communications application Lync and much more The current versions are Office 2013 and Office 365 their cloud based subscription service That s not to say that there aren t pretenders to Microsoft s crown business specialists like Cisco and SAP open source options like OpenOffice and not least Google Apps The service is cloud based so is accessible from most devices and the most basic level free So is the push to the cloud a reaction to competition from Google and other cloud based applications Actually not very much says Mr DelBene We look at where we think the industry is going I think we tend to think in terms of opportunities rather than threats When it s a competitive environment it forces us to do our best work And I think it sharpens your skills We respect our competitors but we think we have a different perspective Offering software via subscription rather than selling consumers a package outright is becoming increasingly common and it s a model Mr DelBene thinks will stick This doesn t mean that it always meets with customer approval however When Office 2013 launched earlier this year the company came in for some hefty criticism Those who wanted to buy the software found they could install it on only one machine And when that machine died so did Office Many felt they were being pressured into moving to the subscription model The company swiftly backtracked We changed that because we did get feedback from customers that it was not well received says Mr DelBene We ll continue to provide the perpetual versions of our products as long as there is demand for it Nevertheless he maintains that most customers will move towards the subscription service to access regular updates The Home version lets you install Office on up to five machines with a scaled price plan for business But should you cancel your subscription after a series of warnings you will only be able to read documents rather than edit or create them The company bought the business social network Yammer in 2012 and recently announced plans to integrate it more closely with Office and Sharepoint their collaboration tool Yammer Enterprise now comes packaged with the business version of Office 365 The suite is also designed to be used with touch screens although Mr DelBene concedes that it could be some time before companies are replacing their desktops with touchscreen computers It s obviously no coincidence that Microsoft launched their own tablet computer in 2012 the Surface But what if you re an Apple fan Office still isn t available for iPad and other iOS devices There are a variety of apps by third parties that go some way to plugging the gap Microsoft have created an app for OneNote but other than this users are forced to rely on web versions which don t work offline For now this is unlikely to change according to Mr DelBene I think what you ll see is a continued investment in web applications as a way of working well on an iPad working well on an Android tablet etc On the future he refuses to be drawn We haven t announced anything at this point he says If a recently leaked document is correct iPad owners may have to wait until 2014 This has caused some to speculate that the company is making a costly tactical error pointing to disappointing sales of the Surface Whether this will give the Surface time to play catch up or whether some iPad users will stop using Office remains to be seen Looking forward Mr DelBene is focusing on better data management We live in a web of information and in some sense I should be able to use that web more effectively to start the authoring process and to express myself moving forward as well He also sees change coming in the types of devices we use at work I think natural interfaces via touch via voice will continue to be important I think we will very quickly get to a place where people can have meetings but all of us are not in the same room yet it feels like we all are because with a few inexpensive cameras we can re image you in the meeting as if you were here As for Clippy things are looking up Following his ignominious fall from grace in 2003 he was resurrected from Silicon Heaven as the plucky protagonist in Ribbon Hero 2 a game designed to teach users about Office He even has his own channel on Youtube You just can t keep a good paperclip down it seems", "Football clubs are no longer content to sit back and take their fans for granted in a global digital age that allows teams in other countries to become both sporting and commercial rivals When AS Roma was bought by a US based group of investors two years ago the club had only a flash website in place with no e commerce portal no social media and no mobile apps or games But despite that slow start the Italian side has been among the most pro active in their use of the likes of Facebook and Twitter in order to monetise their large fan followings When the team was purchased AS Roma was the most under marketed brand in the world declares Shergul Arshad digital business director at the club who has previously worked at Amazon and Time Inc We are based in the city of Rome where three million tourists come through every year But AS Roma had been very focused on fans just in and around the city limit But by moving into the social media and digital sphere the intention has been to take AS Roma beyond those limits to fans around the world and at the same time increase awareness of the club s brand Social media is opening up international communication strands that did not exist before he told delegates at the Soccerex football business convention in Manchester But it is a crowded global market place with many other European clubs seeking to grow a global fan base particularly in regions such as south east Asia and China and North America And he admits that when he first came into his post 18 months ago the club was well behind some English clubs such as Liverpool which had had digital strategies in place for a decade Our audience has this passion this is something that sponsors noticed and wanted to be involved with It has generated a lot of money for us We have brought in an e commerce and social media strategy he says adding that a major part of that has been leveraging the popularity of the club s star players many of whom have Twitter accounts He says the giallorossi yellow and reds are now one of the fastest growing clubs on Twitter picking up followers at a faster rate than the likes of other global brands such as Celtic or Bayern Munich The club also has a hardcore of a few dozen supporters among their total 168 000 followers who tweet a vast amount of information and news about the club We are following those fans and their insights says Mr Arshad We retweet a lot and the fans really appreciate this Meanwhile in its first six months on Facebook the official AS Roma account had one million likes The figure is now close to 1 5 million He says establishing the right tone on Facebook has been important and the club has tried to avoid being too corporate Our basic attitude is that we have to let our fans vent their frustrations or celebrate on our Facebook page because otherwise they may go elsewhere he says Other platforms which the club uses include Youtube and Pinterest The latter might seem a bit unusual being what Mr Arshad describes as principally a shopping community and one whose users are overwhelmingly female It was an opportunity to move into a different demographic and appeal to a new female audience and it also ties in with our e commerce and international approach he says Having established such a comprehensive programme of connections in a relatively short space of time he says the priority of our commercial partners is to access our international fan base Mr Arshad says it is this growing social media presence which helped entice sportswear giant Nike to sign last month a 10 year deal to be the club s official kit supplier from the 2014 15 season And he also points to the club s agreement with Disney to hold the club s winter training camp at the US firm s Wide World of Sports complex in Florida These brands are interested in advertising on our social media platforms he says They are also interested in reaching those three million visitors who come to Rome every year Giuliano Giorgetti is the head of web and new media at AC Milan having worked at the seven times winners of the European Cup for 10 years It is important that there is a digital culture that is growing interest in the club he says Social media is really a fantastic tool for the process of internationalisation of an Italian football club As well as the official club website and mobile phone applications AC Milan is also active on social networks such as Facebook Twitter Youtube Google and Flickr From 300 000 Twitter followers in January 2012 the rossoneri red and blacks now have one million It enables us to have direct communication with international fans and we tweet in a number of languages says Mr Giorgetti All our tweets are in Italian and English and there is some localised content in other languages if our marketing team has a specific objective Indeed he says that more than 70 of the club s Twitter followers come from abroad Meanwhile the club s Facebook page has an impressive 15 million likes again with a predominantly overseas presence For AC Milan there are three areas of monetisation around social media sponsorship e commerce including merchandising and tickets and licensing And Mr Giorgetti says there are different commercial goals associated with each social media platform He points to the fact that being on Google helps boost the club s presence on Google search while being on Youtube brings in advertising around its content on that platform Mr Giorgetti says that digital not only drives more fan engagement but helps AC Milan s business too And Mr Arshad at AS Roma agrees Our audience has this passion this is something that sponsors noticed and wanted to be involved with he says It has generated a lot of money for us", "As so often with books of this type and despite the title BBC business editor Robert Peston s take on the great financial meltdown is long on analysis and rather shorter on solutions but it makes compelling reading Contrary to the endless bleating from coalition ministers about Gordon Brown s debt and the mess that Labour left us Peston is clear where the blame lies It was the bankers stupid Plus the fact that for many years we in the rich world have been living beyond our means our lifestyles funded by surpluses from countries such as China and the oil producers that kept their savings in British banks until the fateful day 9 August 2007 when the bond markets ceased to function For page after page Peston describes the various scams the bankers were into the massive over leveraging the invention of more and more complex and socially useless financial products all fuelled by a toxic bonus culture The one thing they weren t keen on and this has been the case for decades was investment in productive activity manufacturing investment in Germany is 12 times that of the UK The tone is conversational The reader is addressed throughout in the first person which can be irritating I am going to get pedagogic on you but overall it is a lucid expert account of a disaster in which we all have a stake and which is by no means over If the euro goes down we are all in deep shtuck As for solutions there are no easy fixes Regulate the banks by all means break them up even although bear in mind that the City is one of the few areas of the British economy that still turns in a surplus Insist that if multinationals want to do business here they will have to pay our taxes Tilt the economy back in the direction of making things again and adjust higher education accordingly Above all Peston s message is that we may all have to adjust

for sale by Mr Greenberg who had a cellar of some 70 000 bottles But Mr Koch claimed that 24 bottles he had bought for 355 000 231 150 turned out to be fake Mr Greenberg s lawyer argued that his client did not know the bottles were fake and that the blame was with the auction house that sold them I wouldn t sell a fake wine Mr Greenberg told the trial I ve never intentionally sold fake wine in my life But Mr Koch s attorney John Hueston countered that Mr Greenberg went ahead with the sale through the Zachys auction house in full knowledge that the bottles included fakes Mr Greenberg knew it and he didn t tell anybody Mr Hueston told the jury He sold those bottles for top dollars The jury in New York awarded Mr Koch 380 000 247 325 in compensatory damages For Mr Koch who is the brother

economy Lagarde placed emerging economies at the front of the pack ahead of a middling group including the US that has begun to rebuild its battered economies while Japan and Europe were trailing behind She also warned that the world s biggest banks remained a menace to financial stability particularly in recession hit Europe Some of these differences between the leaders and the laggards are likely to surface in the talks this week among the IMF s 188 member countries as central banks fret about their exit strategy from the emergency policies they have used to try to stimulate demand since the Great Recession A chapter of the IMF s latest financial stability report released to coincide with the build up to the meetings warns that long periods with ultra low interest rates and so called unconventional monetary policy such as quantitative easing can spawn serious long term problems even if they succeed in boosting short term growth At home zombie firms and households that would have gone bust can be propped up by super cheap borrowing only to face an even greater risk of collapse when interest rates finally go up Meanwhile some of the cheap money created in the US Japan and the UK will leak overseas as investors seek better returns elsewhere Emerging economies in Asia and Latin America are increasingly concerned about speculative investment flows pumping up their currencies and inflating asset bubbles Despite their positive short term effects for banks these central bank policies are associated with risks that are likely to increase the longer the policies are maintained the IMF warned Depreciation is another welcome by product of the hyperactive central banks policies and there will also be a debate in Washington about the risks of a beggar my neighbour battle to create the cheapest currency Even before Japan s dramatic expansion of its bond buying programme the sharp devaluation in the yen over the past six months had raised concerns in Europe that a strong euro will harm competitiveness Danny Gabay of City consultancy Fathom said an appreciating euro would drive Europe s economies deeper into recession and put the region s fragile banks at greater risk Do they think the banking system that is already under stress from high unemployment and non performing loans can withstand a stronger euro too Face to face talks like those that take place at these IMF gatherings can force policymakers to confront the consequences of their domestically motivated policies but they are rarely persuaded to change their plans as a result Sir Mervyn King the outgoing Bank of England governor is likely to repeat his frequently expressed fear that there remain deep fundamental tensions in the world economy between creditors and debtors savers and spenders which have never been tackled As he put it in a speech in New York in December The G20 in 2009 came together at the London Summit and agreed the easy part which was stimulatory policies where every country could agree But since then there has been no agreement on the need for working together to achieve some element of re balancing the world economy Instead of brokering such an agreement which might involve creditor countries such as Germany and China agreeing to boost their demand instead of relying solely on cutbacks in debtor countries to narrow the divide the IMF has repeatedly been dragged into rubber stamping botched bailouts and harsh austerity policies when tackling the eurozone sovereign debt crisis The IMF is due to reform its governance including giving emerging economies such as China a stronger voice but so far its board members have been unable to agree firm proposals Meanwhile it will stand ready to intevene whenever the next domino falls in the crisis

investor sentiment towards the company during meetings in Johannesburg Virgin Active has 104 clubs in South Africa compared with 122 in the UK A spokesman for Virgin Active described this week s meetings as an exploratory exercise and stressed the company has held meetings with banks in South Africa on previous occasions to evaluate investor sentiment No plans are under way for an initial public offering IPO the spokesman added Virgin Active founded in 1999 has long been viewed as a candidate for an IPO but in 2011 Sir Richard struck a deal with CVC Capital Partners as stock market volatility saw a number of companies postpone or scrap plans to list Virgin Active criticised over reporting standards Virgin Active plans expansion into Asia Virgin Active in the running for 1bn sale CVC took a majority 51pc holding in Virgin Active through the deal which at the time valued the company at 900m However the recent improvement in market conditions and a spate of successful IPOs has

Inner London is the richest part of the entire European Union while Cornwall and Wales benefit from the regional aid dispensed by Brussels There is full employment in the better off towns and cities of the home counties while in Knowsley on Merseyside the true level of joblessness is well over 15 The electoral map of Britain at the 2010 election captures this divide There is little Conservative presence in the big conurbations outside London but only a sprinkling of Labour seats in the south east the south west and East Anglia This regional split which has grown over time is crucial in understanding the mixed feelings generated by the death of Margaret Thatcher That she was revered and loathed in equal measure goes without saying That these opinions are often rooted in a well founded economic rationale is less commonly accepted Let s start with Britain as it was when Thatcher became prime minister in 1979 Contrary to what some of her detractors say Mrs T did not create the north south divide unemployment was higher in the northern regions even then and for decades governments had been trying to compensate for the decline of the staple industries of Britain s mid Victorian pre eminence coal cotton and shipbuilding That s why Harold Wilson put the Royal Mint in Llantrisant and the Girobank was set up in Bootle In the 1930s the centre of gravity of the British economy shifted to the south east which is where many of the new light engineering firms were established Regional policy in the 1960s and 1970s aimed to relocate some of this work car plants in particular to the northern regions Despite these efforts in May 1979 it was much more difficult to get a job in Consett than it was in Crawley and living standards were higher in the south Thatcher s 11 years in Downing Street amplified this existing trend in three distinct phases Phase one was the shakeout of manufacturing in 1980 and 1981 Again this needs to be put into some sort of historical perspective Manufacturing jobs had peaked in the mid 1960s and the workforce had shrunk by a million Britain s industrial competitiveness had been impaired in the 1970s by high inflation offset by a lower exchange rate But the first two years of the Thatcher era were a veritable bloodbath Industry faced a quadruple whammy higher oil prices an appreciating foreign exchange rate courtesy of sterling s emerging status as a petro currency rising inflation caused by a doubling of VAT and high pay claims and sky high interest rates deemed necessary to reduce the growth in the money supply The damage was greater than the Thatcher government expected and greater than it need have been The old industrial regions the north west the north east Yorkshire and Humberside the West Midlands Scotland and Wales went through the wringer Phase two of the process involved right to buy the mass sell off of council houses and financial deregulation Both were popular in southern England because it meant an end to mortgage queues and the ability to buy cut price property in a part of the country where prices were high relative to other regions House prices started to rise sharply from the mid 1980s creating a feelgood factor for those sitting on hefty capital gains Phase three was the big bang in the City This accelerated the economy s transformation away from manufacturing towards the service sector and the financial services sector in particular The government s thinking was that it made sense to exploit the size and international reputation of the City because this was a sector in which the UK had a comparative advantage So by the late 1980s one half of the country was enjoying boom conditions while the other half was still nursing deep wounds from the recession of the early 1980s The property bubble s subsequent bursting and the export led recovery that followed Black Wednesday 16 September 1992 meant the growing regional disparity of the 1980s was briefly arrested in the first half of the 1990s but the trend then re emerged under the three Labour governments from 1997 onwards Both Tory and Labour governments thought something had to be done about the industrial regions For Thatcher the remedy was market forces and encouraging inward investment Labour made a Faustian bargain with the City and the better off citizens of the south east it allowed rampant financial and property speculation using the government s rake off to expand the size of the state s presence in the UK s old industrial heartlands As a report by Manchester University s Centre for Research on Socio Cultural Change put it The rhetorical promise of enterprise under Margaret Thatcher was real jobs in a new economy But in the event and accidentally through deregulating finance Thatcher and Blair did more for the working rich in London and middle class homeowners with equity than they did for unemployed steel or car workers Taken in its entirety the story of the northern regions since 1979 goes like this deep slump in the 1980s in which a huge rise in joblessness was masked by taking people off the claimant count and putting them on incapacity benefit some recovery in employment in the 1990s heavily concentrated in distribution call centres and the public sector further growth in the 2000s driven this time by an increase in public spending that would have been halted whichever party had won the 2010 election The CRESC study found that there had been no private sector job creation in manufacturing rich regions such as the north east and the West Midlands between 1997 and 2010 What s more one of the traditional stabilising mechanisms people moving from north to south ceased to operate In the boom years from 1997 2006 85 of the extra jobs created in London were filled by people born outside the UK The current government s attempts to bridge the north south divide look doomed to failure All but one of the 20 worst districts for hidden unemployment lie north of a line from the Severn to the Wash according to a study last year by the Centre for Regional Economic and Social Research at Sheffield Hallam University The economy s structure means that the growth sectors when it recovers are according to Capital Economics likely to be financial services professional services and communications digital and media All three are concentrated in London which also accounts for almost a third of money spent on regeneration projects The 15bn invested in Crossrail dwarfs spending on infrastructure in the north Indeed the 322m earmarked for new rail

quarter the Department for Work and Pensions says The government initially estimated that 56 000 households would see their benefits reduced by the policy losing on average around 93 per week It now expects 40 000 households to be affected The department said the change came as more people sought help to get into work The policy was expected to save 275m a year when the original figure was announced It now expects to save 110m The lower figure does not mean the taxpayer is 160m worse off The government says JobCentre Plus has already moved 8 000 people in households that would have been affected by the cap into work So that saving in benefit payments and potential extra tax revenue falls in this year They are arguing in effect that the policy is having a positive impact before it is put into place Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said The benefit cap sets a clear limit for how much support the welfare state will provide the average wage for working households But it s also a strong incentive for people to move into work and even before the cap comes in we are seeing thousands of people seeking help and moving off benefits We have a very clear message we will provide support to those who need it but the days of outrageous claims giving people incomes far above those of working families are over Total welfare payments will be limited to 500 per week for couples and single parents and 350 per week for single people without children It means workless households will not receive more in benefits than the average earnings of working households The government has revealed it is to spend an extra 2m trialling the cap The four London boroughs that will begin introducing the cap on Monday Haringey Bromley Croydon and Enfield will receive the money to cover extra administrative costs Just under half of the households expected to be affected are in London A DWP source suggested some councils may face the prospect of re housing residents in other boroughs not yet covered by the cap Ministers say the rise in the amount spent on working age benefits must be slowed The DWP says around 90bn was paid out in benefit payments to people of working age

growth in the benefits bill was being managed at a lower level The government originally planned to introduce the cap across Great Britain by April 2013 Shadow work and pensions minister Stephen Timms

Bitcoin virtual currency lost half its value on Wednesday because of a panic sell off From a high of 260 169 for each Bitcoin the value dropped to about 130 84 in just six hours The selling frenzy began as Bitcoin s main exchange MTGox struggled to keep up with the volume of trade in the virtual currency MTGox said it was working hard to improve the exchange to avoid future trading problems The high of 260 marked the end of a steep rise in value for Bitcoins which were worth only 90 each two weeks ago On Thursday values recovered slightly to reach about 160 104 In a statement explaining what happened MTGox said the delays in trading had not been caused by a hack attack In the past few weeks the exchange and the bitcoin community has been targeted by hackers looking to cash in Instead said MTGox the rather astonishing number of new accounts that had been opened in the past few days caused a bump in trading volumes that it was unprepared for In one day the number of trades in Bitcoins had tripled it said This caused lag or delay which meant that Bitcoins were not swapped between people as fast as needed As expected in such situation people started to panic started to sell Bitcoin in mass panic sale resulting in an increase of trade that ultimately froze the trade engine it said About 80 of all the trade in Bitcoins goes through MTGox Engineers were working to improve the MTGox trading engine to handle the huge number of transactions it said The exchange added that it was planning to shut down for a couple of hours to add servers to help cope with the load Tech news site Ars

on Reddit randomly picked 13 different people to receive the coins One lucky Redditor got a gift of about 5 000 3 250 The vast increase in interest in Bitcoins is also creating problems for some established members of the digital cash community Bitcoins are created or mined when computers complete a complicated mathematical problem Many individuals have pooled their computer power to ensure

figures have shown suggesting that recent tax rises are starting to affect consumers The US Commerce Department said consumers spent a total of 418bn a fall of 0 4 on the previous month The decline

However because the population is growing that number is well below the rate of job creation needed to maintain employment levels The payroll tax rise that came into effect at the start of the year

young accountant at Dixons newly crowned as finance director of its retail operation and steadily climbing his way up the ranks His boss was another high flier Ian Livingston who a few years earlier had set a new record as the youngest group finance director of a FTSE 100 company Livingston went on to become the chief executive of BT Although the two men were cut from similar cloth straightforward clear about their strategies good at detail those who worked with them in their Dixons days remember an undercurrent of rivalry between them as they vied to make their own stamp on the business As animals they are competitive says one former colleague If you were to gut them through the middle it would be written in their blood They may have moved on to different companies in a different industry but they have continued as sparring partners ever since As the heads of two of Britain s biggest media and telecoms businesses they regularly battle over regulation and each does his damnedest to take broadband and telephone customers off the other But what for many years has carried on as friendly opposition is about to step up a gear BT is parking its tanks directly on BSkyB s lawn by going all guns blazing into television BT a 22bn gorilla in puppy s clothing BT could force BSkyB to advertise channel BSkyB blocks Premiership adverts from BT BT ups ante against BSkyB with ESPN deal BT sets sights on ESPN s football rights The telecoms giant caught BSkyB off guard last summer when it made a surprise entry into the market for Premier League football rights staking a 738m bet on 38 matches a season for the next three years They paid a lot for those rights without an obvious strategy That s pretty ballsy says Alex De Groote a media analyst at Panmure It was a particularly bitter blow to BSkyB whose architect Rupert Murdoch effectively created the Premier League in the 1990s when he made football the linchpin of the satellite television operation BSkyB like the rest of the industry was clearly stunned but Darroch s operation was swift to play down the magnitude of what had happened BT didn t have the machinery in place to create a fully fledged pay TV operation in the same league as BSkyB s executives argued and who would want to pay to watch 38 paltry matches a season in any case BSkyB has 116 In fact BT had actually made a bid for all seven of the packages in which Premier League football rights are sold But even though it missed out the looming threat of BT s television service is gathering pace Since its 738m down payment the company has been on a sports rights spree amassing hundreds of live matches from international football leagues like Italy s Serie A and Ligue 1 in France and picking over the bones of sports broadcaster ESPN for the FA Cup It also paid 152m to broadcast live rugby matches from the Premiership and other leagues in a complex move which effectively dismantled the Heineken Cup The new BT Sport channels will broadcast from the Olympic Park with former BBC anchor Jake Humphrey and Clare Balding If Darroch was able to brush BT s threat aside nine months ago he certainly won t feel quite so comfortable doing so now Livingston will not need reminding about the scale of the challenge BT still faces When BT first dipped its toe in the television market in 2006 with the launch of BT Vision it was targeting 3m subscribers for a service which Livingston said could mark the biggest shake up in broadcasting since the introduction of colour TV Fast forward six years and BT Vision remains decidedly low key with just 770 000 customers at the end of 2012 It so happens that BSkyB added broadband and telephone services to its mainstay offer of pay TV in the same year but it made much more progress with these than BT managed with TV BSkyB now ranks as the second biggest telecoms business in Britain successfully transforming itself from a media company into a so called triple play utilities business More than 3 6m customers now take its broadband and telephone services as well as a television subscription A lot of those new users have come straight from BT BT has been very open that its new assault on the sports rights market is partly a defensive move designed to curtail this steady loss Marc Watson chief executive of BT Vision told The Sunday Telegraph last summer that it planned to beef up its pay TV service in order to use it as a calling card to get its foot in the door and help it sell other products This is about creating the opportunity to build more customer relationships he said Whatever we offer customers will need our broadband connection Nine months on he adds that it is a mistake to paint its launch into television as a straightforward BT v BSkyB battle The market is much more nuanced than that We will end up sharing many customers with BSkyB but we also believe we can grow the pay TV market in general he says Livingston is equally keen to play down the idea that he is launching a raid on the customers BSkyB has already signed up Instead he argues BT is gunning for the 15m homes in Britain that still don t take any sort of pay television service But that doesn t mean that the two companies are going to play nicely Last week the gloves came off between the two behemoths in a row over advertising First BSkyB refused to carry adverts for BT s new sports coverage on its own sports channels BT responded that BSkyB was like a rottweiler running away from a newborn puppy and filed a complaint to Ofcom in an attempt to force BSkyB s hand BSkyB was having none of it On Friday it branded BT a 22bn gorilla in puppy s clothing and accused the company of double standards for blocking certain BSkyB adverts on its own website So began a tit for tat war that shows little sign of slowing At one stage there had been talk of BT wholesaling some of its content to BSkyB in a move that would allow BSkyB subscribers to access BT sports coverage for no extra cost and help BT to mitigate its giant outlay However with just a few months to go until BT s service launch expected in early August the two companies have reached a stalemate Whilst the door isn t shut no progress has been made on that point said a source with knowledge of the situation A deal looks very unlikely BT was pushing BSkyB to do a two way deal where they both handed each other content but the two sides could not agree on what to hand over The key principle here is reciprocity of supply of Premier League content so that both of us can offer customers all the live matches in time for the start of the season said a BSkyB spokesman Meanwhile BT is gearing up to reveal full details of its television service and crucially its pricing package next month It is expected to undercut BSkyB and to offer customers a discount on the new television service if they sign up for BT broadband and telephone services as well Prices will be set in a way that is sustainable in the long term but also that helps achieve scale said a source A price war feels inevitable We re looking at downward pressure on prices and more marketing spend says Mr De Groote I don t think BSkyB has any more pricing power going forward That hasn t really shown in its share price yet But the question is whether there is a storm brewing Certainly price competition will come as a blow to investors who have become used to BSkyB enjoying healthy margins and throwing off more than 1bn in cash every year But BSkyB remains a formidable operator It has successfully seen off competition from Setanta and ESPN the two sports broadcasters who won the rights to broadcast Premier League football games in the past and is likely to have more than one trick up its sleeve as it battles with BT If Darroch is feeling the pressure one suspects it weighs more heavily on Livingston BT s shareholders are unlikely to forgive him if his 1bn gamble turns out to be misplaced This is the final roll of the dice for BT on something they have had a go at before says a source Darroch and Livingston are head to head and it appears likely there will only be one winner", "By Jessica Winch 7 00AM BST 14 Apr 2013 Comments The

independent forecast to use the Treasury s model of the economy Sales of household appliances and other expenditures involved in moving home will also be buoyant The Treasury has announced a series of measures to underpin the housing market including a funding for lending scheme which offers cheap loans to banks and aims to bring down mortgage costs In last month s budget the chancellor also promised to introduce a taxpayer backed mortgage guarantee scheme from 2014 The policies have been criticised by some analysts who warned that because many households were still sitting on heavy mortgage debts from the boom years reinflating house prices would be dangerous With the new scheme set to be available on properties worth up to 600 000 Osborne has also been accused of giving help to wealthy buyers However Spencer insisted that the rebalancing that Osborne had hoped for away from debt fuelled growth and towards exports would be impossible while the eurozone economy Britain s biggest export market remained so weak Although it s not a long term strategy stimulating the housing market and the high street will keep GDP growth positive Unbalanced growth is better than no

don t think we re suddenly going to see strong house price growth He pointed out that while prices in London and towns such as Oxford and Reading had already regained the dizzy heights set at the height of the market in 2007 in Liverpool and Glasgow they remained 20 below their peak The government is watching anxiously to see if the latest GDP figures to be published on 24 April will reveal

from Amazon As a student at the University of Birmingham Philippa Parry 25 opened a bank account with NatWest She is doing a post graduate degree in sustainable development run by a London charity Forum for the Future But it was when she was working in Barcelona for three years at a business school that she started to question the ethics of Britain s big banks There were so many examples of where they were not acting in people s best interests with the banking crisis and bailouts Why haven t more heads rolled and why are they still getting big bonuses she says I was also concerned about what they were doing with my money whether they were supporting the arms trade and not trading ethically She looked at different options for an ethical bank on campaign site Move Your Money She chose the Co operative Bank when she moved back to the UK in August a switch that went through smoothly It s a little difficult when I need to cash a cheque as the Co op hasn t got branches in my area says Philippa who lives in Amersham Buckinghamshire But most of the time I do online banking Customer service is always great I don t have to wait for ages and the people I speak to are always pleasant But it s more about ethics That s what bothers me Sales account manager Kate Brooks 37 has experience of two major energy providers nPower and EDF and felt she was always treated as though she was a nuisance whenever she contacted either I was really fed up with their attitude says Kate who lives in a three bedroom house in Polegate East Sussex with her partner Fred Faust 56 and their eight month old baby Oscar They always made me feel like I was in the wrong if I rang up even if it was simply to provide my meter reading The people on the end of the phone just seemed to be reading from a script and I was always put in a long queue before getting through She looked around and found Ovo Energy a smaller provider Not only was it one of the cheapest in the market for her but she liked the way they presented themselves Ovo came across as keen open and honest and I liked that they explained about how they invest in renewable energy she says She applied to move through uSwitch and found the whole process very easy I ve been so impressed with them I ve been telling other people about them including my Dad This time last year Joanne O Connell made the decision to live for a year supermarket free I had ethical qualms about shopping in a supermarket and it s not even that cheap so why bother she says Twelve months on and O Connell who you can follow on Twitter at byesupermarkets and who wrote about her experiences online at guardian co uk money blog is still supermarket free When I started I wasn t sure if I could manage for a fortnight and when friends asked me how I d celebrate the end of my challenge I used to say with a major blowout in Sainsbury s she says But what a difference a year makes Swerving the supermarkets has forced me to change my approach to buying growing and cooking food I am spending less but also eating better healthier meals To achieve her goal O Connell used the year to grow a lot of her own produce She also took to foraging for food such as nettles and learnt to bake bread For dried foods and other essentials she took to bulk buying from a wholesaler which she says saved her around a third on supermarket prices IT developer Onkar Pathre 31 was disillusioned with Virgin Media when he moved a month ago to his new home in Crystal Palace in south east London with his wife Priya 29 a dentist He was part way through an 18 month contract with Virgin for broadband TV and landline but despite wanting to stay with Virgin he was told he d have to cancel his existing contract and start a new one There was a charge of 174 for discontinuing the service and he would have to pay 24 99 a month on his new 18 month contract And the fee only covered broadband and phone because Virgin couldn t provide TV in his area I d been with Virgin for more than three years but it wasn t prepared to simply switch the service to my new address A friend told me about Utility Warehouse he says It doesn t advertise just relies on word of mouth And it pays the termination charges if you switch to them I don t have to take out a contract for broadband so I can leave at any time It turns out Pathre was given the wrong advice by Virgin and he should have been able to move without paying the disconnection charge However he has no regrets His new deal works out cheaper costing 14 99 a month for the landline and 3 99 for the first nine months rising to 7 99 for 14MB broadband The customer service seems very good so far he says", "Back in 1969 a book called The Peter Principle was published and became something of a classic in management texts It may have influenced the odd change in the way businesses operated but more memorably it made readers laugh its central premise being that employees are eventually promoted to jobs at which they prove incompetent So the excellent salesman whose naturally charming patter compensated for his administrative weaknesses and won over thousands of customers proves a disastrous sales manager who can t understand why his team of less enchanting but harder working colleagues don t pull off his trick Worse he remains in that job blocking anyone better qualified from doing it properly Now a chap called Tom Schuller is writing a book with a modern twist It is called the Paula Principle and it argues that most women get promoted to a level below their competence Far from rising to a position their talents don t deserve they languish below what they could easily manage The Paula Principle is a clever joke only with a rather serious point It is 45 years since the Ford sewing machinists strike forced changes that led to the 1970 Equal Pay Act ending discrimination in pay between men and women yet in 2013 there is still clear discrimination over who gets the top jobs Last week Lord Davies whose 2011 review on female representation in the boardroom set a target of a quarter of board posts being filled by women by 2015 was forced on to the defensive after evidence showed that progress towards a more equitable gender balance has slowed For the past six months the percentage of female directors appointed to FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 boards has slipped to 26 and 29 respectively according the latest report from the Cranfield International Centre for Women Leaders This is a long way short of the 33 required to reach Davies s target It is also a marked slowdown on rates seen for the preceding six months 44 and 36 for FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies respectively Women now hold 17 3 of FTSE 100 directorships but just 5 8 of executive roles and 21 8 of non executive posts The deceleration in progress may of course be a statistical quirk and certainly business secretary Vince Cable was careful not to use too much alarming language when reviewing the figures But it seems complacent simply to assume this is a one off When the Davies inquiry launched there was much low hanging fruit The worry now is that the easy early gains have been made and further progress will be much harder to achieve especially in terms of getting more women into executive roles That is illustrated by Cranfield s statistics which suggest that there are simply not enough women in the pipeline with the necessary experience to get to the top Its research shows the percentage of women sitting on executive committees the management level one layer below the board has dropped from 18 1 to 15 3 since 2009 There are probably several reasons for that including issues such as flexible working and childcare but it appears that outright discrimination still hampers those who overcome the restrictions The figures also show that just 48 of female executive directors are internally promoted compared with 62 for men This results in ambitious capable women feeling forced to leave their current company or accept the Paula Principle Davies Cable CBI president Roger Carr and equalities minister Maria Miller all spoke on these issues last week and they all seemed to agree that more needs to be done But none of them expressed a clear vision of exactly what which is worrying if this slowdown proves more than a blip It leaves Britain s ambitious businesswomen hoping that those leading the drive for more female directorships have a Plan B and do not prove to be operating a notch or two above their competence level Even by the eurozone s standards regarding its struggling members the deal Cyprus s politicians will now be forced to sell to a wary public looks especially miserly Of the 23bn total cost of the bailout 6bn more than was agreed less than a month ago by the way Cyprus is expected to find 13bn from its own resources That means as well as the privatisations public sector layoffs and tax rises that have become familiar from the Greek case Cyprus will have to sell off a large chunk of its gold reserves and depositors in the collapsed Laiki bank with more than 100 000 in savings are likely to find themselves completely wiped out There are even rumours the bank may not open on Monday morning Yet also in a familiar pattern the calculations on which the rescue is based are still too optimistic the country is expected to bounce back within a couple of years despite a collapsed banking industry Tourism the country s other main business will hardly have been enhanced by coverage of shuttered banks and riots In Dublin this weekend eurozone finance ministers promised Cyprus structural funds to help rebuild its economy But with the banking bust exacerbated by the bungled bailout it s not clear what exactly they are planning to rebuild And despite euro politicians repeated insistence that the island should not be seen as a template for future rescues the raid on bank balances will mean any renewed whiff of crisis in Spain or Italy will send investors fleeing to the safer haven of Germany or out of the eurozone altogether The collateral damage to the whole eurozone banking system may prove far costlier than the bailout Meanwhile hotel and restaurant owners may be looking longingly across at the Turkish occupied half of their island which can offer a cheap lira and no chance of being stopped at the border and forced to hand over your holiday money Pressure to leave the euro can only intensify There has been an absence of morality and of a reckoning in the aftermath of the British banking crash until recent weeks The report into HBOS by the parliamentary commission on banking standards has provided the catharsis adding empirical clarity to a public anger that has raged without a focal point since 2008 The subsequent statement by former chief executive Sir James Crosby is also one of the first genuine acts of atonement to emerge from that era He was not legally obliged to ask for the retraction of his knighthood or give up 30 of his pension but the moral imperative held sway Unlike Fred Goodwin at Royal Bank of Scotland it did not take months of political pressure to make him succumb If the banking industry is to regain public and political trust it needs to mimic Crosby and find a moral conscience", "US President Barack Obama has unveiled a 3 77tn 2 4tn budget that proposes fresh taxes on the wealthy along with cuts to benefit programmes The White House is offering to trim pensions and healthcare costs but only in return for 700bn in new revenue However the Obama plan is viewed as having no chance of being fully enacted by the deadlocked Congress Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell branded the budget a left wing wish list The Democratic president will host a dinner for Republicans on Wednesday evening to sell his proposals Conservatives have refused to agree to new revenue after passing tax rises on earnings over 400 000 in January We don t view this budget as a starting point in the negotiations Congressional Democrats meanwhile have balked at Mr Obama s compromise offer to cut Social Security pension payments Mr Obama s budget aims to reduce the US deficit by an additional 1 8tn over 10 years bringing total potential reductions to 4 3tn according to administration estimates Cuts in the plan include about 400bn to government health spending and about 130bn from Social Security by changing the way cost of living adjustments are calculated Elderly and disabled recipients with the lowest incomes would be shielded from the changes The cost of living adjustments would also raise 100bn in revenue over 10 years through changes to tax brackets Additional cuts would include 100bn each from military and domestic programmes as well as reductions in farm subsidies and federal employee pension programmes Mr Obama proposes raising revenue by eliminating income deductions for the top 2 of earnings and includes the president s oft repeated Buffett Rule requiring households with incomes of more than 1m to pay at least 30 in taxes The plan also includes some new spending aimed at improving the US economy including 50bn in infrastructure and 1bn for 15 manufacturing institutes across the country Mr Obama has previously cited infrastructure spending as the best possible investment to propel an economic recovery His blueprint would replace automatic across the board cuts known as sequestration to both military and domestic programmes that began on 1 March Those cuts took effect after Democrats and Republicans failed to agree to another plan to cut spending and reduce the US budget deficit Negotiations over the next US budget are expected to run into the summer but the White House says the document released on Wednesday is not an opening offer I have already met Republicans more than half way Mr Obama said in the White House Rose Garden So in the coming days and weeks I hope that Republicans will come forward and demonstrate that they re really as serious about the deficit and debt as they claim to be But House of Representatives budget committee Chairman Paul Ryan argued that Republicans had made enough concessions It goes over old ground It takes more from families to spend more in Washington said the Wisconsin congressman who was the Republican vice presidential candidate last year Mr Ryan s budget proposal already passed in the Republican controlled House sets out 4 6tn in deficit reduction Most of the savings would be realised through reductions in healthcare spending and other domestic programmes without additional tax revenue", "Switch on the television or flick through a newspaper and there s a good chance that you ll come across an advert for online bingo But who is playing and why A typical evening sees Anita Heffernan 50 spending two or three hours playing bingo online It s not for the money her biggest ever win was about 400 and being a game of chance players typically spend more than they win It is a hobby says Heffernan I would much rather do that than spend a night out in town There s been a rapid growth of bingo websites As recently as 2004 fewer than 20 such sites operated in the UK now there are thought to be about 350 Operators include everyone from bingo hall owners Mecca and Gala to newspapers like The Sun and Daily Mail For a game strongly associated with the camaraderie of a night spent at crowded tables with friends any move online could be seen as being at odds with the very reasons for playing Many of the vast concrete and neon bingo halls on High Streets across the country may now be showing their age but millions still visit them every year For the uninitiated bingo is a game of pure chance There s no skill involved other than the ability to keep up in the UK version of the game players listen intently for the random numbers between one and 90 printed on their card to be called out One by one they are crossed off until someone has none left and there s a winner then they might shout bingo or house The figure at the centre of the action the caller traditionally announces each number in a language so familiar it has become corny Two fat ladies 88 clickety click 66 Advertised and played against a backdrop typically drawn in purples and pinks it is not difficult to work out who the marketing for the online version is aimed at says the University of Glasgow s Prof Gerda Reith an expert in gambling and addiction Examples include the suave purple suited fox who leads a bus full of women on a big day out in Foxy Bingo s television adverts They re trying to appeal to people they know like bingo and get them to play online That s women There are younger players Anni Nevison 21 plays two or three times a week including five hours on a Sunday I get excitement and friendship says Nevison who has been playing since she was 18 You go into a bingo site and it s like a little family it s so chatty she says of the other players she messages in the sites chatrooms She would love to meet the people she talks to although that is difficult as they are spread across the UK It is this chatroom type element which is key to the appeal of online bingo for many players Talking is frowned upon in traditional halls while the game is being played the social element happens between and after games lest players be distracted as the numbers are called But online users can talk as much as they like Many sites fill players bingo cards in automatically so that they can concentrate on chatting Online bingo terms have appeared as a result including BLNG better luck next game and HABO have a better one Should they wish to some sites also allow players to message one another privately Traditional bingo s turnover slipped 3 in the year to March 2012 according to Gambling Commission figures with main stage mechanized and seaside style prize bingo turning over 1 22bn Just 4 of people who contacted the problem gambling helpline GamCare said they played bingo Nearly one in five of its female clients were bingo players with some 70 playing online Only 24 went to traditional bingo halls The Bingo Association says there are about 400 halls in the UK half the number in the game s heyday The cost of a bingo card can be as little as 1p although most are about 10p and can be more Prizes can run into several thousand pounds although winnings usually depend on how many other people are playing and are often just a few pounds Few would see themselves as being involved in an activity comparable to poker or playing slot machines but the growth of online bingo is part of the feminisation of gambling says Mark Griffiths professor of gambling studies at Nottingham Trent University The focus on its social aspects makes it more appealing he says People conceptualise it as a bit of harmless fun a harmless flutter and even though they know its a form of gambling they never use the word says Griffiths It might be expected that the growth of online bingo would have seen linked reports of problem gambling but support organisations GamCare and the National Problem Gambling Clinic are yet to encounter it as a significant issue However Liz Karter author of Women and Problem Gambling has seen a significant rise in the number of women with an online gambling problem including bingo The things that they report as being particularly difficult are the constant advertisements it makes recovery very difficult she says The rapid growth of the sites came after the 2005 Gambling Act which swept aside strict regulation and allowed advertising for the first time says Reith Not only could women be actively encouraged to have a flutter but there was also a chance to make up for falling numbers in bingo halls The traditional game is not a money maker bingo is low stakes low turnover and it s got worse since the 2007 smoking ban says Reith Before the ban players could light up inside during games and would have no need to go outside during breaks making the bar and nearby slot machines busier Online bingo provides a chance to make up for some of that lost income The Gambling Commission s 2010 British Gambling Prevalence Survey suggests that 12 of women compared to 6 of men play bingo Among the big brands Mecca Bingo reports that a fifth of the money it now takes is online rather than in bingo halls The shift online is likely to continue says Griffiths who believes bingo is at the centre of a new type of soft gambling Heffernan wagers 20 a night and likes concentrating on the numbers watching the game play out when you get close it s quite exciting I do enjoy it she says of visits to real world bingo halls But it is slow in comparison It is not something her family understands but nor does she expect them to Bird watching No thanks Some people could spend hours looking at car magazines or whatever This is just what I do", "Between the Bitcoin bubble and horror stories of kids running up 3 000 bills on their parents iPad apps digital money has a reputation problem Instinctively we worry that it s too insubstantial and spending it is too frictionless But like it or not virtual economies will play a significant role in our future The global market for virtual goods such as upgrades to video games or special items within them will pass 20bn in 2015 according to analysts SuperData A single 2007 bank crash in the online multiplayer video game Second Life cost 750 000 in real life As a result a group of economists are now hunched over their computers intently studying the exchange of hats Or sofas Or as we shall see daggers made out of hamburgers As virtual economies have begun to intersect with real ones in more powerful ways observing them has changed from an amusing academic pastime to a serious attempt at modelling complex systems Take one example Noticing how much players of the online only multiplayer shooting game Team Fortress 2 seemed to enjoy dressing up their avatars its maker introduced a fetching range of hats They didn t do anything beyond giving the player a certain debonair swagger as she unloaded a hail of bullets into an opponent But people loved them nonetheless and spent real money in the hope of unlocking an unusual hat that rained confetti or was bathed in green smoke Very quickly the hats became a currency For economists virtual economies provide an avalanche of data unlike anything they ve been able to analyse before At Princeton doctoral candidate Juha Tolvanen is studying how players insure their spaceships in the game Eve Online In June 2012 observers were able to track the crash in Diablo III s online market in hamburgers that also functioned as daggers when players discovered they weren t any good for stabbing people with Video game companies are coming round to the idea that their virtual economies can provide real world insights Valve which is behind Team Fortress 2 hired the eurozone crisis expert Yanis Varoufakis as its in house economist last year When I ask him why on earth hats should have become so valuable he reminds me that currency selection is based on some necessary features liquidity intrinsic value aesthetics relative price but also some intangibles Why cigarettes in prison or particular baseball cards among teenagers in the 1960s or salt in medieval Asia Finnish researcher Vili Lehdonvirta author of the forthcoming book Virtual Economies agrees that game currencies show us just how arbitrary our estimations of value are He points to Habbo a social networking game People developed their own currency because the system didn t have an official one So people would trade green sofas and use that as a measure of value Sometimes what s being traded can seem seriously weird to the outsider Lehdonvirta says that in the 1990s text games run by Iron Realms instead of a picture of a sword you d have a description of a sword and sell those for money But if enough people decide that a description of a sword has a value then it does Perhaps the biggest lesson from video game economies is that human beings seem to like markets Daniel James who created the online game Puzzle Pirates says he was taken aback that players wanted to spend their time running virtual shops when they could be buccaneering swashbuckling or generally shivering their timbers He was surprised how aspirational it is for players to be in business and how much work they put in Lehdonvirta sees virtual economies as a rebuke to the early internet philosophers who thought they were creating a world of abundance where objects could be replicated without cost Now we ve discovered this idea called artificial scarcity and discovered that some people prefer that to abundance he says We want to use objects for social signification to set apart the haves from the have nots According to that logic owning a hamburger dagger or a hat wreathed in smoke is no stupider than coveting a pair of shoes you can t walk in or a watch that costs dozens of times the value of the materials used to make it Maybe the new virtual economies aren t quite as new or as weird as they first seem", "Carl Lightbown had help dealing with his injury through the scheme Sick leave leads to long term absence from work in too many cases the government says It hopes a new scheme will get people off benefits and back to work much more quickly But will it work and will it be fair Carl Lightbown had a very common problem A work related injury But how it was treated was far from usual A few weeks into a new warehouse job Carl started having problems with his shoulder a classic complaint which afflicts many manual workers and could have led to months off work The easy option would have been for me to go home and spend weeks months on the sick he said But because Carl lived in Leicester he was able to use a government pilot scheme set up to help people like him back into work quickly before a few weeks off turned into months His GP referred him to the Leicestershire Fit For Work pilot which offers a free occupational health service available to employees in the area It also manages their return to work If you have been out of work for 20 weeks then you have a very low chance of returning to your own job This government funded assessment and advice service is expected to be up and running across England Scotland and Wales from next year The Fit For Work service was able to get Carl physiotherapy sessions immediately rather than him having to wait several weeks for an NHS appointment He was also offered help in arranging a phased return to work Basically they were there to support me while I was out he said His doctor had initially thought he would be off for several months but he was back at work in just under four weeks Julie Potts a director of North Supply where he works says the quick reaction of the Fit For Work service meant that Carl kept his job I m not sure if Carl had only had the support of the NHS whether he would still be employed she said The Leicestershire service is one of seven government backed pilot schemes which emerged out of the first of two reports on sickness absence written by Dame Carol Black adviser on health and work at the Department of Health Peter Day reports on The Sick Note for In Business on BBC Radio 4 at 20 30 on Thursday 11 April and at 21 30 on Sunday 14 April Around 300 000 people a year make claims for long term sickness benefit and sickness absence is costing Britain an estimated 15bn in lost economic output Dame Carol believes early intervention to help someone back to work is vital If you have been out of work for 20 weeks then you have a very low chance of returning to your own job that chance may be only 25 She said the problem is that too many people drop out of work for potentially manageable health reasons like stress or back pain and do not return It wastes human life It ruins people s sense of self worth dignity It s bad for families bad for the economy and bad for the community Lord Freud Minister for Welfare Reform has said that where employers suspect that sickness absence is being abused the new service will also offer an independent view of the situation He said that in a proportion of cases disciplinary action may be appropriate Source Department for Work Pensions The Department for Work and Pensions is still working on the details of the new scheme but Lord Freud said that most people would be expected to go to the service after four weeks of sickness absence unless there is a specified reason not to such as a serious long term illness He expects employers to contribute to the cost of some treatment such as private physiotherapy helped by a tax break announced in the last Budget Dame Carol Black has stressed that she wants to see a positive and proactive assessment service with disciplinary action a last resort But not everybody wants to see GPs lose control of their patients return to work Karen Jennings assistant general secretary of the public sector union Unison is worried that the new service once put out to tender could be target driven meaning some patients are forced back to work too early If you ve got targets you ll do everything that you can to make sure you meet those targets regardless of the individuals involved she said However Dr John Canning a GP in Middlesbrough and a committee chairman at the British Medical Association welcomed the changes I think it will be seen by many as another stick with which to beat people who are not well but everything that I have read so far suggests that it is a carrot But he is worried that the funding seems relatively little The government is spending up to 50m a year on the new service and Dr Canning is concerned about how robust it will be and whether it will be as resilient as we would like it to be He also welcomed the changes because they would relieve doctors of the need to negotiate with employers about their worker s return to work This began three years ago when the old sick note became a fit note It states what a patient is capable of doing rather than not doing and has room to suggest modifications to their work However it became apparent that assessing a patient s work capability and liaising with their employer was too big a task for GPs on their own The new service also aims to look beyond medical problems to other factors that may be preventing people going back to work Dame Carol recommended that the new service offer advice on issues which might be affecting a person s ability to do their job such as debt or difficulty with their line manager Case workers will have to find out a lot about people s lives and where the barriers are to returning to work said Dr Rob Hampton a GP in Leicester and a founder and clinical director of the Leicestershire Fit For Work Service He said that in a quarter of the cases they see poor relationships at work are behind

posted on its Internet Movie Database has had her claim rejected by a jury in Seattle Huong Hoang who goes by the stage name Junie Hoang alleged that offers dried up after the database revealed her age IMDb argued it had the right to publish accurate data and that Hoang 41 could not prove she lost out because of it According to the website her credits include the 2011 title Gingerdead Man 3 Saturday Night Cleaver The site which was launched in the early 1990s and purchased by Amazon in 1998 continues to post Ms Hoang s date of birth on her profile page In court documents filed anonymously in 2011 Amazon and its movie database subsidiary were accused of breach of contract fraud violation of privacy and consumer protection laws Parent company Amazon was dismissed as a defendant before the two day trial which concluded on Thursday The database s stance drew criticism in 2011 from two acting unions who accused the site of facilitating age discrimination During the trial though the site s attorneys said IMDb was not responsible for the actions taken by people who read their profiles Ms Hoang who had been seeking 1m 650 000 in damages had initially provided the site with a false birth year that reduced her stated age by seven years When she asked for that information to be removed the site used a public records search to discover her true date of birth and published it against her objections Speaking after the trial Ms Hoang said she had hoped to make the database change its policy I knew it was a problem not just for me but for anyone else who had their age on their profile she told the Associated Press", "Why can t the government manage its budget like most households do You hear some variation of that theme a lot lately from both sides of the aisle The implication is that American households are good at family finances When we have less money coming in we cut back We balance our budgets by prioritizing what s really important Not everyone goes to Disney World or the beach annually But here s one flaw in the family budget v federal budget metaphors America s tax system favors those who are in debt and penalizes those who save As a friend of mine explained to me when I was in my 20s Want to lower your federal taxes Just have a child and buy a house We pretty much don t pay taxes anymore That s right the more you spend and go into debt the lower your taxes get in America Debt isn t necessarily bad but it s become obvious that much like the US government has trouble getting to a balanced budget families aren t always meeting their commitments either My friend was right For many middle class families buying a house is the biggest help on their taxes They are able to deduct the interest they pay on their mortgage along with property taxes This is followed by up to 1 000 credit per child Then there s the educational tax credit for those who go into debt to pay for university and the credit for donating to charities You can even get money off on your taxes for renting a bank lock box and paying someone to fill out your tax return for you On the flip side if you actually save money you get to pay extra for that privilege The interest you earn on your savings in the bank Yup that gets taxed as income You can argue there are good reasons for the government to encourage people to have children get an education and even buy a house since homeownership tends to build stronger and more stable communities And certainly plenty of good deeds are funded from charitable donations But it s equally true that saving has benefits to people and the economy As Jimmy Stewart s character in the classic film It s a Wonderful Life explains when people try to pull their money out of the local bank You re thinking of this place all wrong As if I had the money back in a safe The money s not here Your money s in Joe s house right next to yours And in the Kennedy house and Mrs Macklin s house and a hundred others Why you re lending them the money to build and then they re going to pay it back to you as best they can Reports are that Americans save only about 4 of their income Compare that to China and India where households save over 30 or many parts of Europe where people save over 10 We are a nation of spenders We are also a nation heavily in debt personally and via our government The current US debt works out to about 53 000 per individual We are coming off a home mortgage crisis that sent us into one of the worst recessions in our country s history and we are likely in a college debt bubble We ve basically got a savings crisis It s time to alter some tax incentives to encourage saving At the moment there are some savings promotions Many workers take advantage of retirement savings vehicles which can be tax deductible when you put money in or take it out You can also put money into special health savings accounts public transportation accounts or even government run college savings plans You can also buy tax exempt bonds The problem with many current vehicles is that they are mostly pegged to a certain type of expenditure like healthcare Or you have to lock up your money until retirement It s not a flexible system Frankly the United Kingdom has a far better savings program with the Independent Savings Accounts ISAs Individuals can put just over 5 000 a year tax free into these cash accounts This is not a tax haven for the wealthy A few thousand dollars in a tax shelter isn t going to make much different to millionaires But it does make a huge different to low and middle income families who are trying to put some dollars away for a house for a car for a vacation you name it Money in ISAs remains tax free until taken out It can stay for a year or many years It s up to the saver The ISA program also lets the competitive market work Banks compete for customers by offering good rates and there are advertisements in UK for these savings products savings are actually promoted As any US saver knows it would be nice not to have to fork over extra money to Uncle Sam because you did something responsible like saving for a rainy day And if more people start saving maybe the government will figure out how to do a bit of that too", "A City worker catching an early train on 14 September 2007 from Edinburgh to London via Newcastle home of the

building companies how to get people working for us really motivated and steamed up Despite the east coast route s steady progress in public ownership Branson told the Guardian in stark terms If you just work for the government you don t get people hungrily trying to make a real difference But a Thatcherite zeal for privatisation aside he now owns Northern Rock as well the Virgin tycoon is too canny to confirm he would match the premiums paid to the Treasury by DOR After all he has twice before been outbid for the line In the past three years DOR s east coast operation has returned more than 600m to the government This is more in real terms DOR points out than any other previous franchisee If the issue of state versus private comes down to how much it costs to subsidise the nation s railways the case for public ownership of the east coast is surprisingly strong Instead Branson argued that Virgin would provide massively better value to taxpayers overall through a combination of investment and premiums We d want to invest considerably in improving the track trains and speed times Passenger numbers and therefore revenue could be driven up Branson believes City analysts agree there is scope for growth particularly if Britain s wider fortunes pick up But Douglas McNeill investment director at stockbroker Charles Stanley counsels A long distance franchise like East Coast is more subject to economic fluctuations than commuter services There s more discretionary business and leisure traffic And National Express bet on a level of passenger growth that did not materialise So is it realistic to believe now that a private operator could deliver a better service for a lower cost making profits for shareholders and still paying premiums to a government which has promised to cut state support for the railways Branson has consistently argued that his rivals overbid unrealistically for the east coast and the financial records bear out a history of operators trying to squeeze out more than the line could bear The three sets of accounts filed at Companies House setting out the performance of the nationalised east coast mainline provide a stark insight into what the state inherited from the first private operators The maiden accounts for DOR for the nine months to March 2010 paint a picture of a business which was suffering from underperformance and underinvestment For long term sustainable health a business turnaround is required the directors said Train performance was a worry but the engineering organisation was the biggest concern There has been a prolonged period of underinvestment and support In 2011 s report they expanded Safety performance had been deteriorating There was a poor safety culture in the business The latest report suggests the east coast franchise has improved under state ownership by almost every measure The lack of investment has been reversed and as a consequence this has started to translate into improved performance That performance covered safety standards and a more engaged stable and committed workforce And punctuality and customer satisfaction scores measured by the Passenger Focus survey were at record levels for the line Yet directors recognised that there are still significant issues to be addressed The 936 miles of track have had nothing like the money spent by Network Rail on the west coast mainline a transformative 9bn state investment Branson s Virgin Trains the main long distance operator on the west coast has benefited as a consequence taking home 382m in dividends over 10 years shared with co owner Stagecoach On the east coast line severe delays have again hit the service in recent weeks with overhead line failures making a mockery of last year s punctuality scores In fact only one operator fares worse on current annual average punctuality Virgin And while East Coast argues that 80 of delays occur as a result of external factors the need to overhaul its ageing train fleet is an imminent serious problem The latest East Coast accounts underline the challenge that a private operator faces if it assumes control of the line That company must match DOR s payment profile help fund an overhaul of the infrastructure and the trains and generate a decent profit for its shareholders In the 28 months to 31 March 2012 the last period for which accounts have been published the east coast line generated more than 1 5bn of turnover for DOR In the same period combined retained profits were just 10m With net assets of just 7m DOR has the hallmarks of a thriving not for profit business not a successful private business A significant turnaround has been executed at no cost to the government which had received financial premiums of 416m by 2012 a figure East Coast says will total 640m when the latest accounts are filed The business is in better shape makes unprecedented returns for the state and remains in the black But this is a business which is hungry for continued investment and one with significant direct costs The wage bill is 115m a year it has annual lease commitments of 140m and must pay a financial premium to government of approaching 200m At the same time there is a pension deficit of nearly 90m to be funded For all that Branson is unlikely to be the only private sector investor who believes despite previous failures that there is still plenty to be squeezed out of the network by increasing passenger numbers His 49 partner in the Virgin Rail group Stagecoach is reticent about bidding for the east coast again but Branson believes both the private sector and the taxpayer can benefit He points to a tripling of passenger numbers on Virgin Trains west coast services over the past decade The subsidies the government had to put in were enormous Now the government is the net beneficiary The broader context was of course that the 9bn west coast upgrade was underwritten by the taxpayer not Virgin Yet Jim Steer of transport consultancy Steer Davies Gleave says that whoever picked up the tab credit has to be given to Virgin for turning around the west coast It doubled the number of intercity trains coming out of Euston and can point to having brought in radically different and challenging new trains the Pendolinos so it does have a track record Steer warns that increasing capacity is complex especially at the southern end of the eastern route and he points out Unlike on the west the train s just not fast enough to compete with the airlines Yet returning the east coast line to any operator who promises to ramp up passenger numbers raises a wider question about investment Branson talks of building new track money that would of course again ultimately come from the public purse The boom in rail travel has also forced the case for high speed rail on capacity grounds The 33bn bill is the government says a necessary price to pay before space runs out on the west coast main line If Branson or any private operator is to end the alleged stagnation on the east coast line the taxpayer will be called upon again", "Last year I received an offer letter on my Barclaycard PPI claim of 7 264 7 dated 10

weekly supply market indicators SMI which they say forecast profit margins significantly above those they actually make The figures have formed the basis of recent reports suggesting profit margins of the Big Six suppliers have more than doubled to about 100 per household per year stoking public anger at a time of rising household bills Ofgem itself has published conflicting statements about whether the SMI reflects profits In a consumer factsheet published on Thursday entitled understanding the profits of the large energy suppliers it explains that the SMI give the latest information on energy prices and profit margins But the regulator told The Sunday Telegraph that the SMI does not show profits The row over Ofgem s data comes ahead of a parliamentary hearing on Tuesday when executives of the Big Six companies will appear before MPs on the Energy Select Committee to discuss profits prices and poverty Energy firms double profits to 95 per home Record rise in North Sea oil and gas expected 5m homes in debt to energy firms Shell demands Nigeria do more to stop rising oil theft Shale gas could boost UK economy says BP BP faces dissent over chairman and pay at AGM The companies are expected to face questions over whether the levels of profits are fair whether they should be doing more to shield consumers from rising prices and whether they pay enough tax in the UK In written evidence to the MPs British Gas said Erroneous assumptions in Ofgem s SMI methodology materially overstate reported margins by around 35 75 It warned that trust in the energy sector is being undermined as a result and said the regulator must urgently review its system Centrica said British Gas s post tax profit margins typically the highest in the industry had averaged 5pc for the past five years and were currently the equivalent of 50 per customer SSE which also raises the issue with MPs criticised the SMI in a blog Deputy chief executive Alistair Phillips Davies wrote Ofgem s methodology appears to have a consistent bias towards overstating profit margins He pointed out that over 2010 and 2011 Ofgem s annual estimated profit margins averaged 73 per customer But a quick comparison with Ofgem approved accounts for the period shows that on average they actually earned 30 per customer The Ofgem factsheet published last week shows that the Big Six suppliers average pre tax profit margins fell to 3 1pc in 2011 It also says that the SMI suggest that margins and consumer bills have increased since 2011 Its latest SMI says The rolling average net margin for a typical standard tariff dual fuel customer is approximately 95 That implies a net margin of 6 7pc based on Ofgem s figure of 1 420 for a typical bill An Ofgem spokesman said yesterday it was incorrect to compare historical data with the SMI Our indicator represents a snapshot estimate of the prices that suppliers charge their customers and the costs that suppliers face this gives an indication of profitability in the market Our analysis is for a typical customer on a standard variable tariff It is not an attempt to model actual profits of individual companies Ofgem had consulted widely on our methodology for SMI he added The Big Six suppliers are all expected to come out strongly against charges of profiteering at Tuesday s hearing and have used written evidence to insist their profit margins are fair SSE has told the committee it wants to increase its margin to about 5pc in the medium term which it said was reasonable lower than sectors such as telecoms and necessary to justify investments in power plants The Big Six are preparing for scrutiny over the tax they pay Centrica and SSE have revealed high tax contributions but critics say the accounts of the other four foreign owned suppliers E On nPower ScottishPower and EDF Energy are less clear It is thought one of the firms that has invested heavily in new power plants has used legitimate allowances to cut its tax

costs them to process a payment The Office of Fair Trading OFT estimates this at about 2 5 on credit cards and about 50p on debit cards But some customers say not all firms are complying says Which which adds that consumers who feel they are being overcharged should complain Companies still seem to be charging excessive surcharges Many firms have changed their charging policies to comply with the new rules but some at least do not appear to have done so Since 6 April customers have been contacting both Which and Radio 4 s Money Box to complain Richard Lloyd executive director of Which told Money Box that firms had to act We ve had a huge response from people who are saying companies still seem to be charging excessive surcharges Now it s a question of how well this can be enforced and that the clampdown actually happens Some travel firms in particular still seem to be charging a lot more for credit card transactions than the OFT guidelines indicate Brian from Tyne and Wear booked

Liverpool docker will be leader of Unite until 2018 Mr McCluskey said he was honoured to have been elected for a second time We are living in extraordinary times with workers facing unprecedented attacks on their living standards and their rights at work Now more than ever working people need a union which will stand up for them Mr McCluskey has been an active trade unionist since 1968 becoming an officer of the Transport and General Workers Union in 1979 and then national secretary for the General Workers group in 1990 In 2004 he was promoted to become the union s national organiser for all the service industries including public services construction and the voluntary sector Mr McCluskey later became Unite s assistant general secretary for industrial strategy He has been a member of the Labour Party for more than 40 years The election result was much closer than expected with the turnout just over 15 It was called by Mr McCluskey with two years left of his term to run Since his election as general secretary in 2010 the Unite leader has set up a 25 million dispute fund to support union members financially and overall membership to the union has risen since his appointment He has been an outspoken critic of Ed Miliband s leadership despite having played a key role in getting him elected Unite the Labour party s biggest financial donor was one of several unions that criticised the shadow chancellor Ed Balls and the Labour leader Ed Miliband for backing the ongoing pay restraint in the public sector According to Mr McCluskey the party needs to put some flesh on the framework of an alternative and warns that if that alternative is not radical enough Labour will lose the next election In 2012 Mr McCluskey was heavily criticised for raising the possibility of protests during the Olympics with the Conservatives describing him as unpatriotic In an interview before the conference he told the BBC that he did not regret his comments about the Olympics despite the subsequent backlash He said he wanted a successful Olympics and he expected protests against the government s austerity programme to continue long after the Games were over On the

that there is enough wealth in homes and private assets across the Mediterranean to cover bail out costs The rich must give up part of their wealth over the next ten years said Prof Bofinger The two economist are members of the Germany s Council of Economic Experts or Five Wise Men a body that advises the Chancellor on major issues There is no formal plan to launch a wealth tax but the council is often used to fly kites for new policies Prof Bofinger told Spiegel Magazine that it was a mistake to target deposit holders in banks the formula used in the EU IMF Troika bail out for Cyprus where those with savings above 100 000 at Laiki and Bank of Cyprus face huge losses The canny rich in southern Europe just shift their money to banks in Northern Europe to escape seizure he said Prof Feld said a new survey by the European Central Bank had revealed that people in the crisis countries are richer than the Germans themselves This shows that Germany has been right to take a tough line of euro rescue loans he said The ECB study found that the median wealth of is 267 000 in Cyprus compared to just 51 000 in Germany where home ownership rate is just 44pc and large numbers of people have almost no assets Slovenia cuts growth forecast as bail out fears grow Slovenia faces contagion from Cyprus Cypriot authorities confirm raid on big depositors Slovenia could avoid full blown bail out

75 000 for Portugal Average wealth in Cyprus is 671 000 far higher than in the four AAA creditor states Austria 265 000 Germany 195 000 Holland 170 000 Finland 161 000 The ECB survey has hardened attitudes in Berlin dooming efforts by Cyprus extract more money from the Eurogroup as rescue costs surge from 17 5bn to 23bn The study shows how EMU states have twisted themselves into a Gordian Knot under monetary union and why Germans feel a strong sense of grievance over escalating bail out demands Yet it is also highly controversial since it relies on data before the housing crash in Spain and may understate implicit wealth in Dutch pensions or German life insurance Any attempt to enforce a wealth tax in future rescue talks will be seen by Club Med as further evidence that the Northern powers will try to impose all the burden of crisis adjustment on those in trouble rather than accepting their own shared responsibility for the failings of the EMU This comes a day after Germany said over the weekend that their could be no banking union after all without a fresh EU treaty effectively kicking the issue into touch for years Critics have long argued that North Europe is equally to blame for the crisis since it flooded the South with cheap credit and they accuse Germany of destabilizing the intra EMU trade system by screwing down German wages and running a current account surplus of 7pc of GDP Any serious move to a wealth tax could the erode the pro euro ardour of South Europe s uber rich The ECB bond buying policy has largely rescued the wealthiest strata while the

the western world claim to have been personally affected by the economic slump that most citizens expect to drag down living standards for decades to come according to YouGov Cambridge The academic polling thinktank found 57 of Britons 64 of Americans and 54 of Germans had been personally affected by the economic problems of their countries during the last five years to a great or fair extent The French whom happiness researchers routinely find are given to accentuating the negative are gloomier 80 of them claim to be feeling the pinch personally More shocking than the reporting of present penury is abject pessimism that sets in when YouGov Cambridge s questioning turned to the future Respondents were asked whether despite the recession they were basically confident that our children s generation will end up enjoying a better standard of living than our generation just as our generation has mostly been better off than our parents the reassuring rider reminding them that whatever the ups and downs of the cycle the slow miracle of economic growth has eventually touched most family s lives by roughly doubling the size of the world s big economies every 30 years But even after this prompt 19 of Britons 15 of Americans 16 of Germans and 17 of the French agree with this statement Instead overwhelming respective majorities of 64 65 66 and 59 incline to the view that the younger generation will find it harder than ours to enjoy a reasonable standard of living Within the British economy particularly there is evidence that recent personal experience is feeding through into a dismal view of distant future horizons Only 15 of those who have suffered materially from the recession incline to the view that the rising generation will end up better off in the end compared to 27 nearly twice as many of those who have escaped the big squeeze In the other economies the link between personal experience and expectations for the distant future are far more muted suggesting that the recession may be exerting a particularly divisive effect on British psychology A separate series of questions on the opportunities available to young people also suggested that recession hit Britons are becoming gloomier in a distinctive way The 57 of Britons for example who believe that whereever you start in life enough hard work will bring you success is very much in line with the 61 of French respondents who say the same but in Britain the recession hit are considerably less likely by some 14 points to take this cheery view than those who are not feeling the personal squeeze whereas in France personal experience makes no substantial difference In Britain alone YouGov asked a near identical question in August 2012 and at that point 59 feared that the younger generation would find it harder as against just 23 who then feared that the young would find it tougher to achieve a reasonable standard of living over the course of their lives The 64 19 split of British

Britain Statoil of Norway has said the UK s system of power market price reporting is open to manipulation and gaming and needs to be shaken up The damning assessment of the UK system from one of the world s biggest energy companies comes six months after the Guardian triggered an investigation by City and energy watchdogs with a report detailing concerns about wholesale gas market rigging raised by an ICIS Heren price reporter Seth Freedman The inquiries into the 300bn market started by the then Financial Services Authority and Ofgem are still looking at the way the price reporting agencies such as ICIS cover the markets as well as how energy companies go about their wholesale trading activities Huge gyrations in reported prices on 28 September last year raised fears that it could represent market manipulation similar to Libor interest rate rigging a scandal that has undermined financial markets and led to fines of 290m for Barclays and 390m for Royal Bank of Scotland The prices reported by agencies such as ICIS form the basis for long term contracts and one explanation for the 28 September price movements is that traders stood to benefit by manipulating the benchmark price In a letter in response to a consultation exercise launched by ICIS and published on its website Statoil UK s regulatory affairs adviser Shelley Rouse said the current price reporting methodology should be amended to improve the transparency and reliability of the calculations and the pricing indices We are concerned that the current methodology allows for the potential use of incorrectly reported trades to be factored into the index calculations which can result in inaccurate prices being published she wrote Statoil would support the use of a daily weighted average of reported physical trades This will enable the published pricing indices to fully reflect the traded market and would reduce the opportunity for gaming or market manipulation As part of the same exercise another of the world s most powerful energy companies RWE of Germany said it too may not always have full confidence in the accuracy of their reporter led price assessments Centrica the owner of British Gas also expressed positive views about basing prices on deals done through exchanges rather than on the over the counter OTC market ICIS owned by Reed Business Systems has now promised to set up an alternative system of price reporting based only on actual executed trades which will run alongside its current system In a statement signed by Louise Boddy head of gas and power at ICIS Heren she admitted her company needed to address these concerns Responses to this consultation do show consensus that a deals based closing index methodology would provide a reliable measure of closing market value ICIS will therefore develop a new pricing methodology to provide this she said ICIS proposes to run a new closing index alongside certain closing assessments in a first phase lasting at least six months After six months of publication ICIS will analyse the reliability of this index It will also go back to market participants for feedback on the reliability of the index and potential replacement of the existing assessments Freedman was critical of the methodology used by ICIS alleging among other things that his fellow reporters were not trained properly He was subsequently sacked and has launched an unfair dismissal case Concerns about how all price reporting agencies conduct their business have also led to calls for changes from the International Organisation of Securities Commissions This comes amid a trend for longterm wholesale contract prices to be linked to OTC gas prices established by companies such as ICIS and Platts rather than oil prices as usually happened in the past But the OTC market estimated to be worth around 300bn annually is largely unregulated and prices are hard to establish because the price reporters often have to rely on talking to only one party in any deal In February three major brokers launched their own set of indices covering the UK and Europe based on confirmed transactions The Tankard benchmarks have

eurozone in its present form arguing that the vision of a united Europe is in danger of imploding if debt ridden countries are not shown the door Speaking before the founding conference on Sunday of a new breakaway political movement which wants to fiercely challenge Germany s support for eurozone bailouts Joachim Starbatty a professor of political economics who has filed repeated complaints with Germany s constitutional court arguing that eurozone bailouts are unconstitutional said the EU would collapse if the eurozone battle was allowed to continue Europe is tearing itself apart right now said Starbatty A currency which is supposed to have united a continent is doing precisely the opposite And it is weak and ailing largely due to the fact that individual members are no longer in the position to be able to sustain it Therefore it would be better if these countries that are not competitive like Greece Ireland Spain Italy etc were to leave An alternative he argued would be for Germany to leave Starbatty is a staunch supporter of Alternative f r Deutschland Alternatives for Germany which held its inaugural party conference on Sunday The movement is made up of intellectuals from surgeons to economists the number of professors has caused it to be dubbed the professor party as well as small and medium business leaders and retired professionals It already has 6 000 members and is set to liven up Germany s national election in six months time With a name inspired by alternativlos meaning there are no alternatives a word which the chancellor Angela Merkel has used in defence of many of her policies including eurozone bailouts the party wants to prove her wrong particularly in the case of the euro Many would like to see the return of the deutschmark Analysts are sceptical that AfD will garner the 5 of votes necessary to gain seats in the Bundestag Economically Germany is continuing to doing well which impairs the chances of protest parties considerably said Richard Hilmer from the opinion pollsters Infratest Dimap But AfD still poses a grave threat to Merkel s Christian Democrats CDU their Bavarian sister party the CSU and the pro business Free Democrats all of which are in a coalition which they hope will be re elected on 22 September Even the loss of a few hundred seats could force Merkel to invite the centre left Social Democrats to join her in a grand coalition which would necessitate a watering down of her policies or cost her power altogether At the election any votes for the AfD could really hurt the CDU admitted Wolfgang Bosbach of the CDU His colleague Klaus Peter Willsch added Such a party is dangerous for us Starbatty says the AfD s aim is to shake awake the political elite of both Germany and Europe His profile is typical of that of other members a long standing member of the CDU who left in protest at how Germany has been forced into the role of Europe s disciplinarian in order to uphold its pro European stance as it tries to save a currency which he argues was flawed from birth Many German politicians are sticking their heads into the sand he said They do not want to admit the reality that their dream project cannot continue to function in its current state because they believe so much in the dream and they fear being seen as anti European They fail to recognise we need to find a healthy way forward which despite being painful will help propel Europe upwards The 72 year old who describes himself as an economist of the Adam Smith school recalled the then chancellor Konrad Adenauer s first visit to Greece in the 1950s Then only seven policemen were needed When Merkel visited in 2012 7 000 police protected her What does that tell you about the feelings of solidarity Europe is supposed to have forged Starbatty resents the label anti European that the party is often given preferring instead Eurosceptic He also rejects the comparisons with Ukip with which he says AfD has very little in common We are pro Europe we want to save it and the only way to do that is to either dissolve or consolidate the eurozone It is not nor will it in its current form bringing the peace and unity that its creators promised he insisted The party is screening all potential members to ensure no far right elements enter its ranks after criticisms that it would attract neo Nazis This comes from the German idea that if you re not with the majority you must have extremist leanings said Starbatty That is one of the reasons it is far from easy to found a new party in Germany Rejecting outright as it does the policies of Merkel the party is far more inclined to align itself with the British prime minister David Cameron We re by far from being in agreement with everything Cameron says but we respect his plan to hold a referendum said Konrad Adam a journalist and former publisher of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung who is one of the founding members of AfD He has a British sense of realism a cool and healthy approach which we could do with more of in Germany added Starbatty A recent poll suggested that 26 of Germans fearful of the future of their economy and resentful that their savings had suffered were prepared to vote for an anti euro party The figure rose to 40 for the 40 to 49 year old age group But one problem the fledgling party might face is the advanced average age of its members which one observer estimated to be only slightly under that of the Vatican conclave But the party s would be leadership insisted that many younger supporters are waiting in the wings to see

best places in the world to create a new business He s so confident about the claim in fact that he s going to put his own money and future behind it Having helped create the Government s enterprise policy framework the senior policy adviser to the Prime Minister announced earlier this month that he is leaving Number 10 this summer to launch his own start up business in the field of online education In his first in depth interview Silva is clear about how much he believes David Cameron and George Osborne have achieved saying the Coalition has put in place the most radical and ambitious enterprise agenda of any country in the world When it comes to Whitehall however and the civil servants who are often the conduit between business and government he is not so sure He is particularly concerned about the lack of engagement with thousands of often unheralded smaller businesses the lifeblood of the UK economy We ve got a set of ministers who really get the needs of business says Silva 32 But all of us on the political side were surprised when we got into power in 2010 at just how close the relationship was in Whitehall with big business How Thatcher brought UK back from the wilderness Coalition must maintain Thatcher s pro business spirit Tech City firm storms spreadsheets to avoid London Whale style losses Tech City under threat from twin rival projects Canary Wharf hosts new bid to grow UK s technology business When we were elected 95pc of government contracts went to companies with more than 250 employees and 70pc of government IT contracts went to just seven companies We ve got rid of some of the most absurd rules you could imagine that really speak for that cosy relationship between Whitehall and big business Where s there s still a way to go is on the culture change There s still an assumption among many in Whitehall that big is best when it comes to procurement It s something we re focused on addressing and turning around Silva is best known for his work on the Tech City initiative in east London and for pioneering the Government s life sciences strategy to attract and support biotech and pharmaceutical companies in a cluster based around Cambridge He will join Index Ventures the private equity firm in June for a six month entrepreneur in residence assignment before launching his start up Before he goes he details further ambitious plans to strengthen the Government s commitment to start ups and entrepreneurs They include A concierge service to support overseas entrepreneurs with the immigration regulation and start up services they need to set up in Britain and take advantage of the London Stock Exchange s relaxation of the listing rules for start ups Considering strengthening the Technology Strategy Board by setting up a British version of America s Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency which incentivises entrepreneurs by offering prizes for meeting technology challenges Silva stops short of confirming the move but says an announcement will be made this summer Increasing the proportion of government procurement contracts awarded to small companies Taking up the suggestion of Autonomy founder Mike Lynch to require the provision of hourly non stopping trains between London Liverpool Street and Cambridge into the next Department for Transport rail franchising agreement for the route Silva has also been involved with enterprise policy initiatives including creating entrepreneur visas tax breaks for angel investment opening up government data and making government spending more transparent Tech City pictured above was launched in November 2010 after entrepreneurs in the Old Street technology cluster asked for help with the area s infrastructure and image problems Investors in the UK and across the world didn t take the cluster seriously Silva says They didn t visit there was no press coverage and no global companies were set up there There were maybe 200 digital companies there at the time but the scene was very fragmented Now the number of digital companies in east London has grown to 1 300 That s truly remarkable and means that Tech City is far and away the fastest growing technology cluster in Europe supporting about 50 000 jobs We now have Google Intel Cisco Systems Microsoft Amazon From Silicon Valley to New York and Israel people know something very special is happening there Google Silva points out has only one employee in Tech City s new seven storey Google Campus with the rest of the space reserved for start ups There s also a Tech City apprenticeship programme with 500 places offered by leading tech companies and an apprentice training centre in the Olympic Park Tech City s profile has also been strengthened by the recruitment of former Facebook Google and Bebo executive Joanna Shields as chief executive of the Tech City Investment Organisation Silva now wants better awareness of the initiative among Chinese and Indian companies which have yet to invest in the area He also wants more government action to support emerging technology themes such as big data and smart cities The life sciences strategy launched in 2011 aims to support the industry s move away from expensive big pharma in house research and development teams to open innovation partnerships with universities and start ups Silva believes the opening up of NHS data represents a huge opportunity for Britain to attract early stage life science companies aided by 200m of funding support while the nation s commitment to sequence 100 000 genomes is the most ambitious genome project anywhere in the world It s all about getting ahead of the curve and making sure that the UK is as competitive in this new paradigm of life sciences as we were in the old one he says So can Britain really now call itself a nation of entrepreneurs Silva is adamant it can Last year there were more businesses started in the UK than at any time in British history he says That s an amazing achievement Historically the challenge in the UK has been getting access to start up money That s always been hard to come by in the UK but we now have the world s most generous tax breaks for people who have the courage to risk their money in a start up Citing the exemption from capital gains tax for investors in start ups a flat 10pc rate of entrepreneur relief for owners selling their companies and a 10pc capital gains tax for share options given by start ups he says These policies are better than anywhere else in the world To attract would be entrepreneurs from outside the UK to come to Britain Silva says his team s entrepreneur s visa is so radical that governments around the world are scrambling to match it He declares At a time when Labour is yelling Soak the rich and the mood in Europe is increasingly anti enterprise and anti wealth creation for us to introduce a policy that radical is absolutely remarkable We as a government are even more radical on enterprise than the Thatcher governments in the 1980s We have three cabinet ministers in Michael Fallon Jeremy Hunt and Grant Shapps who have started their own business In stark contrast I don t think there s anyone in Ed Miliband s shadow cabinet who has ever started a business On Silva s advice Whitehall procurement rules that stipulated businesses bidding for government contracts had to have three year trading records have been scrapped along with a good deal of accompanying bureaucracy Some 15pc of overall government procurement contracts now go to small and medium sized firms and the Government wants to increase this to 25pc by the next election When we were elected the Government was spending 15bn a year on IT says Silva That s more per head than anywhere else in the world We simply weren t getting our money s worth The contracts were going to a handful of global IT companies because there are only a few IT companies in the world that can handle a 5bn IT contract We will save as much on IT spending over the course of this government as we will on welfare We ve already taken more than 3bn out and will get down to low billions in IT spend The challenge is that the last government signed lots of eight year IT contracts which was just crazy Making the case at every turn for insurgent disruptive businesses is hard because they are typically disrupting an established old company or an old way of doing things in government I m really proud of the way we always stand by the new guy Now Silva will become a new guy himself saying his propositions in online education will focus on the developing world and the potential for technology to dramatically improve education opportunities Is he doing it to make his fortune or because he is fed up with the slow pace of Whitehall He says no to both suggestions Entrepreneurship is about making new things happen in the world In this case I hope it s about trying to improve the education system and trying to ensure that people across the world get access to the best possible education using technology to obliterate distance and open up access to the best content That s a social mission It s not about pounds and pence It s about making a difference I ve been talking about starting my own business for at least the past 10 years This really is a golden moment for entrepreneurship in the UK Age 32 Married to Kate an architect Education

there is almost no hope of a deal at this stage Whilst the door isn t shut no progress has been made on that point said a source with knowledge of the situation A deal looks very unlikely The news

ups ante against BSkyB with ESPN deal However BSkyB claims that BT is the one that is refusing to share content We are very open to entering into mutual supply arrangements for next season The key principle here is reciprocity of supply of Premier League content so that both of us can offer customers all the live matches in time for the start of the season a spokesman said Without a content

television package The service is set for launch before the new football season starts in August The telecoms giant will offer its pay TV service at one price if it is taken as a standalone service but will reduce the price if viewers sign up for BT s landline telephone service and broadband as well The model is the same as that used by BSkyB which has been steadily increasing revenue per customer by selling telephone and broadband contracts on top of television packages Analysts claim that few sports fans will sign up for both BT and BSkyB s sports packages and predict a price war

lost a claim against him at the High Court in London The firm which provided nearly 27m to help the businessman purchase Rangers Football Club two years ago said it had also been awarded interest and costs The former chairman of Rangers has until 26 April to lodge an appeal The court battle has no effect on current operations at Ibrox The judgement handed down last Friday ordered Mr Whyte to to re pay 17 7m plus 680 000 in interest as well as legal costs Ticketus which is part of Octopus Investments said the court had ruled that Mr Whyte failed to disclose his business background when he signed for the finance in return for a portion of three years of season ticket sales The company described these as serious and deliberate misrepresentations BBC Scotland revealed in October 2011 the then Rangers owner had previously been banned as a company director In a statement Ticketus said Ticketus would not have entered into the ticket purchase agreement with the club if Mr Whyte had disclosed as required relevant information concerning his previous seven year disqualification from serving as a director and the reasons for the disqualification Under Craig Whyte s ownership Rangers went into administration in February 2012 over non payment of VAT and National Insurance totalling about 14m The contract with Ticketus was subsequently terminated by the administrators Duff and Phelps but it emerged Mr Whyte gave personal and corporate guarantees over the deal Mr Whyte lost control when the assets of Rangers Football Club were eventually taken over by a new company run by Charles Green s consortium with the oldco liquidated Ticketus court action has not been for the full 27m The amount it sought 17 7m covers the value of what it invested with the 9m difference made up by the profit it expected to make if it were successful in meeting its season ticket sales targets Going after the lower sum was thought to be a simpler legal process but Ticketus is understood to be leaving its options open for further legal action to recover the full sum The company said Mr Whyte sought to counter sue and that these attempts were rejected The BBC has not been able to see the actual wording of the High Court judgement In a separate development Craig Whyte claimed last week he was prepared to go to court to prove he is still the owner of the football club s assets Mr Whyte was unavailable

of the infrastructure albeit on grossly uncommercial terms on which countless subsequent fortunes were built More than half of the length of today s rail network was built with money raised before the crash More than a decade on from the dotcom crash of 2000 Simon Clark the latest chairman of the British Venture Capital Association BVCA insists London s much hyped cluster of small technology companies is well placed to capitalise on the same principle The people who made 90pc of the money weren t the people who built the railways it was those who figured out how to operate them the application of the technology The real value gets created after the crash by people who bring pieces of knowledge and technology together to solve new problems The UK is in a good position to do that because it s a mixing ground bringing different cultures together to create something new It pays for Clark who is also managing partner of the European arm of Fidelity Growth Partners to be a cheerleader for the industry but he is in a better position to judge than most In a technology role at Reuters in the 1990s he cast his eye over the likes of then minnows like Yahoo as potential investments for the news agency s venture arm Then towards the end of the decade he joined US financial news website The Street as finance director helping it grow from start up to an eventual flotation Clark took a job with Fidelity in 1999 and came to London a year later to set up the US investor s European operation I was the only guy here The other venture firms who had come over had

tech scene is maturing nicely The other day I was one of 18 bids when I thought I d got in early It s a big negative for me but terrific for entrepreneurs The UK market has become a global one If you re a hot London company you will get attention from US investors in a way that you didn t five years ago For all Clark s optimism he even believes that London s stagnant IPO market might be poised for a return to action he admits that the growth capital market that should be feeding flotations is tiny Last year there were just 80 venture capital deals for companies with sales of between 5m and 100m in the UK according to the bank owned Business Growth Fund The competition from rival investors that Clark faces for good quality deals shows that shortage of capital is not the issue he insists Yet a dearth of good businesses isn t the problem either Instead he blames a lack of entrepreneurs being willing to sell a stake to venture capitalists You still find many companies here that would rather be the biggest in Gloucestershire and not go through the pain of trying for world domination I understand it but it s a shame he said He cites the example of Holly Tucker and Sophie Cornish founders of online gift marketplace notonthehighstreet com a Fidelity investment as all too rare examples of entrepreneurs willing to heed advice from investors You have to ask Do you want to be rich or do you want to be king he says Clark s primary aims in his year long tenure as the spokesman for the industry are to attract more overseas investors into UK funds and to challenge European Union rules which discourage insurance companies and pension funds from allocating capital to private equity and venture capital While the infamous criticism of the industry as locusts following pre financial crisis buy outs that resulted in accusations of asset stripping has lost some of its sting there is still some way to go Clark readily admits the industry s image needs a polish not least among entrepreneurs Clearly there s an issue of trust and there s work to be done We ve all heard some horror stories It s our job to show good long term capital can help build better businesses", "Worried mothers in

"The BBC s Jennifer Pak on creative solutions to living in small spaces in Hong Kong In Hong Kong every corner and gap is precious Architect Gary Chang knows he grew up in a 32 sq m 344 sq ft flat in the Kowloon area The flat was partitioned into three tiny bedrooms a kitchen and a bathroom Mr Chang slept in the hallway while five other family members squeezed into two rooms Incredibly they also rented out the third bedroom Mr Chang says this experience was not unique in the territory in the 1970s Back then many people would live together under the same roof he said We learned to be less vocal in order to keep the peace between family members Four decades later however the housing situation has not improved much Property prices in Hong Kong are among the highest in the world According to government statistics flats the size of Mr Chang s family home in the heart of Hong Kong had doubled in price between 2007 and 2012 to an average of 108 546 Hong Kong dollars 13 980 9200 per square metre Even in older neighbourhoods further out in Kowloon where Mr Chang grew up apartments cost HK 80 216 per square metre More and more Hong Kong people are coping by living in smaller spaces A family of four commonly lives in a flat of less than 50 sq m Those at the bottom of the scale cram into older flats that are subdivided into cubicles The poor also rent so called cage homes wire mesh cages that can only fit a thin mattress stacked on top of each other The areas are poorly ventilated and have inadequate sewage facilities posing health and safety risks The existence of such appalling living conditions have cast a dark shadow on the thriving territory said Hong Kong leader CY Leung in January during his first major policy speech Mr Leung pledged to tackle the housing problem by building 92 000 affordable homes over the next five years In the meantime those who can afford to own or rent apartments try to adapt to smaller living Mr Chang has found a stylish way to maximise space in his childhood home where he now lives alone Five years ago he installed tracks on the ceiling and rollers to build a sliding wall system to transform the open plan studio apartment into many different rooms He gently pulls the steel handles along the walls to show a walk in closet on the other side then slides another panel out to reveal a full sized bathtub At the other end of the apartment a kitchen is hidden behind the wall upon which the television is mounted I m too lazy to walk So I ve designed the apartment in a way where the rooms transform around me Every room uses the entire floor area to maximise space he said Mr Chang did not specify how much he paid for the renovations but said they cost as much as the flat itself Few people in Hong Kong can afford that investment So for most residents it s a constant battle against clutter On the other side of the territory Maple Ma and her husband Dave Li live in an apartment twice the size of Mr Chang s but they are starting to feel cramped When we buy something it s always a concern whether we have room for it If I buy a piece of clothing I might have to throw another one away Ms Ma said It doesn t always happen but that s what it s come down to The hardest place to find storage is the kitchen the narrow area tucked behind the living room also doubles as the laundry room So Ms Ma has learned to adapt by cooking with only one electric pot The gadget can grill bake fry defrost and steam using a halogen light as heat It replaces her oven microwave and electric stove The Hong Kong company behind the appliance German Pool says sales of the halogen cooking pot have increased 40 fold since 2006 to 100 000 last year amid growing demand for space saving gadgets that perform multiple functions German Pool started by selling electric water heaters but later branched out to kitchen appliances Adapting gadgets to Hong Kong s living conditions is what will drive the company s future growth says managing director Edward Chan In many of our cooking appliances we want to contain the grease splatter and steam so that cooking is more enjoyable in tiny spaces said Mr Chan But he says that although customers want to save space they do not want to skimp on quality German Pool s latest product is an automatic stir fry pot that can cook raw grains of rice into a decadent sticky rice dish in 12 minutes without splattering grease over the countertop Hong Kong has long dealt with a housing crunch But an industry based on small spaced living is only starting to grow now says associate professor of architecture at Hong Kong University Jia Beisi In the past people had to make whatever space they had work because they had large families he said Now that residents have more money and smaller families they are willing to spend on gadgets or renovating their small space to make apartments more multi functional he added Small living can also turn out to be quite luxurious as Mr Chang has proven His apartment transforms into a home theatre a blue projector screen unfurls slowly with the click of a remote He hangs a hammock on industrial hooks attached to the ceiling It s my favourite room he said For Mr Chang there is always room for indulgence no matter how small the space", "More must be done to help clamp down on rogue letting agents industry experts and disgruntled tenants have told the BBC An amendment to regulate letting agents is due before the House of Commons next week If approved the changes would see agents required by law to belong to an ombudsman scheme Figures obtained by the BBC show that very few of those acting outside of the law are being punished The Property Ombudsman TPO received more than 8 000 complaints about letting agents from landlords and tenants in 2012 an increase of 9 on the previous year But the BBC s 5 live Investigates programme has learned that only 12 prosecutions were carried out last year by trading standards teams in 20 of the biggest councils in England Scotland and Wales At the moment anybody could set up as a letting agent they don t have to have minimum standards Andrea Fernandez from Hampstead in London fell victim to a rogue letting agent last year and has been left nearly 3 000 out of pocket I had to move out of the property because there was a serious problem with mice and he wouldn t do anything about it I was waiting to get my deposit back but he was making excuses all the time trying to charge me for things he could not explain Then he stopped replying to my emails He vanished I tried to get my deposit back but found out it was not protected A leading trade body said it was disappointed by the low numbers being prosecuted If there is seen to be a robust procedure then that is itself a deterrent said Ian Potter managing director of the Association of Residential Letting Agents ARLA We do know that a lot of local authorities work very hard when they get a complaint to try to get bad practice improved but I think what prosecution does do is send a warning shot across the bows of anyone that is not operating properly in a market place But trading standards officers said prosecutions were a last resort If you had very high numbers of prosecutions that means that trading standards have not succeeded in bringing about compliance said Karen Ford from the Association of Chief Trading Standards Officers ACTSO It is not the case that we get a breach and therefore we go in and prosecute because that s the polar opposite of what we should be doing she added Listen to the full report on 5 live Investigates on BBC 5 live on Sunday 14 April at 11 00 BST Since 2008 estate agents have been required by law to be part of an approved redress scheme but letting agents are not Labour peer Baroness Hayter of Kentish Town is proposing the amendments to the current Enterprise and Regulatory Reform ERR Bill to change that Legislation already requires estate agents to be part of an ombudsman scheme What this amendment would do is extend that so that letting agents would also have to be members of an ombudsman scheme she said At the moment anybody could set up as a letting agent They don t have to promise to give minimum standards to the tenants or to the landlords The proposal is due before the House of Commons on 16 April People living in private rented homes should be treated fairly and honestly but we want to avoid excessive red tape that would push up the cost of rents and reduce choice for tenants a spokesman from the Department for Communities and Local Government said The first priority must be to make sure that landlords and tenants are well informed and empowered to exercise their rights Agents are subject to consumer protection laws and dissatisfied customers can report bad practice to local trading standards officers he added In Scotland measures have recently been taken to regulate the lettings industry The law currently prohibits prospective tenants being charged premiums on top of their deposit and rent in advance but some letting agents have been charging various fees for years In November 2012 a clarification of the law was put through the Scottish Parliament which states that additional charges such as reference checks credit checks and inventory fees are unlawful But a mystery shopper exercise carried out by 5 live Investigates found that some letting agents were still charging fees The programme contacted 25 letting agents across Scotland and found a quarter were still passing charges onto tenants You can hear

accounts Those who have savings in Switzerland could find the value of their deposits reduced by up to 41pc on May 31 when the tax authorities impose a withholding tax on British savers who have not fully disclosed their investments and paid all taxes due to HM Revenue Customs HMRC Last week HMRC issued new guidance which it hopes will encourage those with money saved in offshore bank accounts in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man to declare their gains The message is clear If you don t take advantage of the amnesty that started at the beginning of the month the penalties will be severe when a full exchange of bank details begins in 2015 Britain s tax authorities estimate that they can squeeze 9bn out of illicit offshore accounts in the next five years Tobin Tax is madness for Europe and economic war against Britain UK signs tax deal with top eurozone nations Tax changes to wipe out Christmas bonuses HMRC struggles with computer glitch amid PAYE shake up The scale of offshore evasion came to light a decade ago when a former bank employee of the LGT Bank in Liechtenstein stole records of 6 000 customers using the principality to avoid paying tax and offered to sell this information to various national tax authorities In 2008 the British Government is believed to have paid 100 000 for 100 names off the rich list subsequently raising 100m in unpaid tax Authorities in Germany Australia and the US have also pursued names on the list with Germany paying 3m for details of 750 tax cheats HMRC will not comment on the case but confirms it is happy to pay for information about non payment of tax Liechtenstein realised it had to get its house in order and reached lenient agreements with other countries designed to encourage their nationals to be honest with the authorities and pay any undeclared taxes It remains the best place to get your affairs in order if you have serious irregularities in your relationship with the UK taxman Meanwhile changes to the EU law gave the British Government limited snapshots of accounts held by some UK institutions It is negotiating an automatic information exchange on all accounts held in the Channel Islands and Isle of Man which will make concealing money significantly more difficult from 2015 All these destinations have reached slightly different agreements with Britain about the penalties that will be imposed So it would pay for those with large amounts of unpaid tax to study these carefully before deciding which haven it is best to have their money in when handing themselves in It is worth noting that there has been a sharp increase in tax evaders jailed for fraud with 11 locked up last month alone This is particularly important when remembering that some of those with untaxed offshore treasure troves may have come upon them almost by accident and are not determined tax fraudsters Some money it is true will reflect overseas and UK earnings of individuals and companies who have deliberately put wages and profits out of the reach of the UK tax authorities Other funds will be criminal money But many other citizens may have inadvertently been landed with an offshore account that has now turned into a tax headache either because they were born or lived abroad or because they have inherited some money Derek Scott a partner at KPMG said They may have known they had this problem for some time but just didn t know what to do about it It was in the too big a minefield to touch box Sometimes parents have deliberately put a sum of money offshore to leave to their children So the children who subsequently inherit it are not the tax avoiders but they don t know what to do with it We are also now seeing many clients who were born abroad or whose parents were born abroad and then moved to this country Money has been kept offshore when perhaps it should have been subject to UK income and inheritance tax Unravelling these arrangements can seem very daunting And daunting it is Last week s guidance from HMRC on its new disclosure facility agreement with Jersey Guernsey and the Isle of Man says no one will be prosecuted if they make a full and frank disclosure and pay all tax due with interest and penalties However unlike in Liechtenstein there is no non prosecution guarantee written into the agreement Stephen Camm a tax partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers said It is this guarantee of no prosecution which many who come to us find appealing Last month 11 men including a barrister an accountant directors of a film company and wine smugglers were jailed for up to six years for tax fraud This follows the recent imprisoning of two businessmen who lied about accounts held offshore in the Isle of Man They ran a computer company for the car trade and did a great deal of business with the German motor industry These earnings were not declared but were banked offshore When questioned by HMRC who were alerted by German tax officials they declared one account but concealed a further 10 Liechtenstein s disclosure agreement also has advantages if you have inherited sums on which inheritance tax is due It only seeks to go back to 1999 so any inheritances before this date will be excluded Additionally you can opt to pay a composite rate that may be lower than the inheritance tax due Below we look at the penalties and arrangements with some of the most used offshore locations If you disclose in one of these offshore havens you must pay any tax owed going back to 1999 with interest and a penalty The penalty will normally be based on 10pc of the tax owed for years to 2007 08 and 20pc thereafter From 2016 if the automatic exchange of information goes ahead as is anticipated all banks and savings institutions will have to give HMRC details of account holders and bank accounts Previous disclosure agreements have been limited to offshore accounts held by UK persons and only to the extent that information existed in the UK for example on computer servers sited onshore or the information could be accessed in Britain In many circumstances Liechtenstein may offer the most generous option under the Liechtenstein Disclosure Facility LDF but account holders would be advised to do the maths first The penalties are generally slightly lower 10pc for all years to 2008 09 Furthermore investors can elect to calculate any tax due using a composite rate tax of 40pc This is applied to income and gains arising on the asset Added to this are interest and penalties This can then satisfy all taxes due including inheritance tax for all periods before 2009 From May 31 all British citizens with accounts in Switzerland will have between 21pc and 41pc lopped off their balance They will then pay 27pc to 48pc on future income and capital gains Special rules apply to UK resident non domiciled persons However they can prevent this withholding tax by making a full disclosure of their tax irregularities and paying any tax Swiss account holders who choose to disclose may be able to do so using the LDF This will normally be cheaper for them see above as well as safer They can access the Liechtenstein arrangements by establishing an asset in Liechtenstein now", "The National Audit Office is to investigate the disappointing amount raised by Ofcom s auction of the 4G airwaves which in June generated 2 3bn a total of 1 2bn less than the Treasury had forecast and 3bn less than the theoretical maximum In a letter seen by the Guardian the NAO s auditor general Amyas Morse told the Labour MP Helen Goodman shadow minister for media and communications I intend to conduct a value for money study of Ofcom s recent auction of 4G spectrum The Treasury s forecast of 3 5bn to be raised in the auction was included in the government finances at the time of the autumn statement last December and allowed the chancellor George Osborne to claim that government borrowing was falling The Guardian understands that the NAO is now preparing the terms of an investigation after complaints from Goodman who pointed to remarks by the Ofcom chief executive Ed Richards indicating that the government had not made maximising revenues the prime aim of the auction By not making maximising the auction s revenues an objective for Ofcom the government has failed to get value for money on this project Goodman complained to Morse The 4G auction sold off more radio spectrum than ever before to bidders including the four main mobile networks and BT By comparison the 3G auction in April 2000 raised 22 5bn Figures published by Ofcom in March showed that the highest bids for 4G spectrum came to a total of 5 2bn But Ofcom said those were only theoretical because it was using a rule whereby winners only paid slightly more than the second highest bidder similar to an eBay auction a measure taken to make the auctions harder to rig Goodman said she welcomed the NAO s intervention It is entirely right that the National Audit Office has launched this investigation Serious questions must be answered as to why the Conservative led government ended up 1bn short of the estimate George Osborne had provided just months earlier When the 3G auction took place Labour ensured that maximising revenue was an objective The Conservative led government did not do the same for the 4G auction which I believe was a serious mistake Some sources at bidders felt that the design of the auction using a system known as combinatorial clock which has been used in other countries to sell off 4G airwaves not only worked against maximising revenue but was also unsatisfactory for bidders Ofcom neither raised the amount that the government was looking for nor did it ensure that spectrum found its way into the hands of everybody who wanted it one bidder told the Guardian when the figures were released Their dissatisfaction could also become part of the study Morse told Goodman that Ofcom had a responsibility to ensure that the auction delivered an economically efficient allocation of spectrum The allocation after the auction means that Vodafone s share of all UK mobile spectrum has leapt from 23 to 28 while that of its rival O2 has dropped from 20 to 15 and that of the smaller Three network from 18 to 12 Though the NAO does not have the power to order a rerun of the auction a report from the study expected to last some months will go to the Commons public accounts committee which in turn can censure the government and demand a response from Osborne Ofcom defended the auction design as benefiting consumers A spokesman said The 4G auction was a success which will deliver the maximum benefit to UK citizens and consumers in line with Ofcom s statutory duties It will create competition with five companies able to launch competitive 4G services This will lead to investment in new services greater innovation and lower prices plus enhanced coverage with a rule to cover almost all of the UK population by 2017 at the latest The auction was designed to promote competition and ensure coverage rather than to raise money These benefits will deliver significantly more value in the long term to the UK than simply the revenue raised in the auction",

bank s favour in which it had been awarded 19m This was despite court evidence from an RBS trader Sam Griffiths being found to be unreliable We look forward to pursuing Highland s case against RBS in

"Cold weather payments hit a record level for March with 642 900 households receiving 16 1m in help towards energy bills These payments go to those on Pension Credit and many other income related benefits Each seven day period of freezing temperatures results in an automatic payment of 25 to eligible people The previous record number of payouts for March was 543 600 which was made in 2006 However even if the cold weather continues this year the cut off point for payments is 31 March The payments made by the Department for Work and Pensions are aimed at ensuring vulnerable people especially the elderly are not tempted to keep the heating off because of financial worries After the payment is triggered it takes 10 days for the 25 to reach accounts Those eligible for the payments include those who receive Pension Credit or income related Employment Support Allowance or are families with children aged under five who are in receipt of an income related benefit Anyone who thinks

treaty had to be changed to allow common rules on shutting troubled banks a key element of the union Banking union only makes sense if we also have rules for restructuring and resolving banks But if we want European institutions for that we will need a treaty change he said after a meeting of European finance ministers The banking union is one of the currency bloc s central measures to stabilise the euro and prevent taxpayers from footing bills for bank rescues But Mr Schaeuble who has long held reservations about the banking union said they would not be able to take any steps on a doubtful legal basis He also made clear that legal change would be necessary for the unified scheme for tackling failed banks Altering the Lisbon treaty which underpins the bloc s law would be lengthy as it needs the agreement of all member states As a first step towards the union the European Central Bank is poised to start supervising eurozone banks from July next year A bank resolution scheme to

Schaeuble s comments came as David Cameron and his German counterpart Angela Merkel held talks at her rural retreat Officials at Number 10 stressed the warmth of the relationship between Mrs Merkel and Mr Cameron who along with his family was given the rare accolade of a stay at the mansion Having held talks at Mrs Merkel s guest residence at Schloss Meseberg Downing Street said the two leaders had agreed on the urgent need to make Europe more competitive and flexible The pair also want the EU to be prepared to make an ambitious offer in trade talks with the US They agreed on the urgent need to make Europe more competitive and flexible and talked about ways to achieve this And they discussed how we can work together in the run up to the May and June European Councils to make further progress said a spokesperson for Number 10 They both want to see faster progress on trade deals between the EU and the rest of the world And they agreed that the EU should be prepared to put an ambitious offer on the table for EU US negotiations which we want to get underway this Summer America and the EU aim to start negotiating a vast free trade pact by June but the plan faces many hurdles before it could help revive the world s top two economies The deal would be the most ambitious since the founding of the World Trade Organization in 1995 embracing half of world output and a third of trade The deal has support at the highest level it was mentioned by US President Barack Obama in his speech to Congress and cast as a central pillar of Britain s G8 presidency this year The prime minister used his overnight stay in the Brandenburg countryside to set out his plans to renegotiate Britain s relationship with Europe but the Downing Street statement offered no clue as to how they were received Mrs Merkel is anxious that Britain should remain in the EU and has made no secret of her concerns about Mr Cameron s plan to stage a referendum on continuing membership if the Conservatives win the next general election in 2015 On the EU the PM set out his approach to European reform following on from his speech in January the Downing Street statement said The two leaders also discussed the forthcoming G8 summit which Mr Cameron is hosting at Lough Erne in Northern Ireland and the need to show global leadership in tackling tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance They also discussed the upcoming G8 summit in Lough Erne and especially how the G8 countries should show global leadership by taking concrete action on tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance and making clear that everyone must pay their fair share of taxes Downing Street said on Saturday They will also work together at the May European Council and the G20 to achieve wider progress on global

itself following two decades of civil conflict The International Monetary Fund today recognised the federal government of Somalia headed by President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud paving the way for the resumption of relations after a 22 year interval the IMF said in a statement The decision is consistent with broad international support and recognition of the Federal Government Although Somalia has

boss Philip Clarke will lay out plans to revive the supermarket s largest stores on Wednesday when he reveals the first fall in profits for 20 years The retailer is expected to report that underlying sales growth has slowed since Christmas despite investing 1bn to boost Tesco s fortunes in the UK since a shock profits warning a year ago Cutting prices and hiring more store staff has so far failed to offset the impact of the horsemeat scandal together with tough competition from discount stores such as Aldi and ongoing difficulties with Tesco s non food ranges Either it is solving the wrong problem or trying to solve it in the wrong way said Dave McCarthy a food retail analyst at Investec In reality Tesco s problems are multidimensional While Tesco tries to improve service and reassure shoppers after finding horsemeat in some of its products it is also experiencing difficult trading conditions overseas The retailer is expected to reveal a 1bn hit to profits from exiting the US after putting the future of its California based Fresh Easy chain under review last year Rivals including Aldi are thought to have shown an interest in taking on stores but no deal is expected to be announced this week Even before the US hit profits are expected to have fallen by 10 to 3 4bn in the year to February Revenues are thought to have risen 1 6 to 66 2bn Tesco has recently announced a buy out of the family restaurant chain Giraffe and also holds stakes in Harris Hoole coffee shops and Euphorium bakeries Clarke is expected to outline how these businesses will help add pizzazz to stores covering more than 6 300 sq metres 60 000 sq ft A year ago Clarke said Tesco would put the brakes on opening such large stores in the UK as shoppers increasingly choose to buy closer to home rather than pay for the petrol to drive to hypermarkets On Wednesday Clarke is expected to announce similar plans in eastern Europe and other foreign markets where Tesco will put more effort into building online sales and opening small local stores Profits in markets such as Hungary Poland and the Czech Republic have fallen back amid the Europe wide economic difficulties Tesco s sales are also thought to have taken a battering in South Korea after the government brought in new restrictions on trading hours Meanwhile the retailer is turning to independent shopkeepers to help drive its expansion by offering franchise deals on its One Stop chain One franchise outlet has been operating for a few weeks and the group is aiming to sign up a handful of new partners to test the concept over the next six months One Stop s chief executive Tony Reed said We and our customers want to see neighbourhood convenience shops thrive Our franchising concept is about helping good independent family businesses make an even greater success of their stores Many independent convenience stores operate under so called symbol groups such as Londis Spar and Budgens giving them better deals on stock as well as help and advice on marketing Tesco s concept would in effect work in the same way with independent retailers paying to use the One Stop name sourcing stock from the parent company and sticking to certain rules on their stores layout A spokeswoman for One Stop which operates 640 of its own stores said We believe this is a real opportunity and feel there s a gap in the market because we can offer something different to independent retailers One industry insider said independent retailers would have to decide whether they should continue to compete with Tesco or would be safer in the arms of one of their biggest rivals Some groups might get agitated but the world has now changed and everybody is trying new ideas he said Tesco is the largest convenience store operator in the country running about 1 500 Tesco Express stores as well as the One Stop chain", "Another year another drop The odds are that the impending announcement on the new rate for the national minimum wage will see a further decline in its real value meaning a lost decade for those on the lowest pay Wages right across the earnings spectrum have fallen so many experts will greet this news with a shrug But that s unlikely to be the reaction of those toiling at the sharp end of the jobs market where working poverty is escalating and people are living on ever tighter margins even before the arrival of the majority of cuts It wasn t supposed to be like this From its modest beginnings in the late 90s the minimum wage climbed steadily It eradicated the worst extremes of poverty pay and created a ripple effect that spread upwards and lifted the pay of those further up the earnings curve Wage inequality between the middle and the bottom fell and the incentive to work rose Like no other policy for a generation it blended sound economics progressive ends and popular appeal Yet even before the recession struck the national minimum wage had lost its mojo For some years its declining fortunes were reflected in the paucity and predictability of public debate on low pay That s now changed The enormous pressure on living standards is opening up fault lines across politics It s led some on the left to lose faith in the gradualism of the national minimum wage and the Low Pay Commission made up of employers unions and academics which oversees it They favour usurping the late 90s settlement on low pay replacing it with an externally imposed increase in the minimum wage to bring it into line with the far higher living wage though it s important to note that the living wage campaign itself rejects this legislative approach You can see the argument as work by the Resolution Foundation and the Institute for Public Policy Research shows big employers in some important sectors could afford to pay the living wage without it resulting in a major hit to their overall wage bill in part because the bulk of pay is skewed to the top Meanwhile the potential savings to the taxpayer owing to lower spending on tax credits and benefits and higher tax revenues run into billions But leaping straight from the minimum wage to a statutory living wage would be a big roll of the dice even in good times never mind in a stagnant economy with high youth unemployment Many small firms would struggle to adjust as they have less scope to absorb wage pressures through changes in productivity profits or prices And crucially it would undermine probably fatally the Low Pay Commission That would be a mistake The national minimum wage is a rare example of an issue where evidence has triumphed over prejudice particularly in a culture where the current is fast moving the other way Recall that 20 years ago the very idea of a wage floor was dismissed as voodoo economics by the then Conservative leadership as well as most of business who felt free to assert that it would cost millions of jobs It didn t as the commission has demonstrated There is now a near consensus among economists about its benign impact It s a belated recognition of this verdict that has spurred a new debate on the centre right with pragmatists from influential skills minister Matthew Hancock to key players at the Daily Telegraph moving beyond grudging acceptance of the existence of the minimum wage to making a more full throated case for strengthening it True these are still relatively rare voices And yes they exasperate their numerous ideologically charged colleagues who have a more sceptical approach to the evidence But those from the Conservative side calling for more ambition in tackling low pay do so secure in the knowledge that they have politics as well as economics on their side Some 72 of the public don t trust the government on low pay and when they were last asked the overwhelming majority thought the wage floor should either be higher or remain at its current level only 4 said it should be lower What this flux means for policy remains to be seen The risk is that today s growing consensus around the importance of the minimum wage fails to move us beyond the current inertia The opportunity The increasing noise coming from a range of voices creates the necessary momentum for new policy ideas to gain traction Fifteen years after its conception the Low Pay Commission has plenty of hard earned credibility the question is how to deploy it A starting point would be for it to have a remit that reflects its title currently it s a minimum wage setting commission That s vital but narrow work It should also oversee a low pay strategy that sets out the changes necessary across skills workforce organisation and enforcement to help ensure higher pay and improved progression over the next decade And it should grapple with the problem that often besets minimum wages they increase only at the pace of the slowest A wage floor that is affordable across all parts of the economy from finance to farming will by definition mean large parts of the economy are feeling no upward pressure from it The commission is well placed to identify key sectors capable of sustaining higher wage floors above the legal minimum without damaging jobs And all this should run alongside moves to bolster the living wage extending its reach across the public sector forcing companies to report on low pay and encouraging cities to take a lead by sharing the fiscal dividend with them Millions of working people on low incomes face the prospect of prolonged pay stagnation and falling tax credits with only the mirage of future tax cuts Rising living standards ultimately depend on wider economic reform not just the minimum wage But a stronger wage floor would give us something solid on which to build", "The Scottish government is proposing an independent Scotland could take on a public sector debt burden at just over half of the rate faced by the whole UK The SNP administration has estimated the share of the UK s debt if it was allocated based on population It contrasts this with what it claims is the different position if Scotland is credited with revenue from oil and gas over the past 30 years The UK Treasury said the analysis was based on favourable assumptions Scotland s share of the UK s debt would be a part of any negotiations following a Yes vote in the independence in September 2014 A new volley of statistics has been fired during the past week by the Scottish government To what end Well the political intention is clear to kill off the notion that Scotland is incapable of paying its way That used to be an argument often made against Scottish independence often helped by citing in isolation the higher spending per head on Scottish public services It s only heard these days from those who have failed to keep up with the debate The SNP s latest publication Scotland s Balance Sheet provides campaigning ammunition pointing to Scots paying more in tax and spending less as a share of the economy as a whole on services such as pensions and welfare The UK faced public sector debt in 2011 12 of 1 100bn 72 of Gross Domestic Product GDP the main measure of an economy s output Ministers at Holyrood said that a share out of that debt to an independent Scotland on the basis of its population share would come to 92bn Because Scotland has a higher GDP per head if oil and gas is included that equates to 62 of national output Scottish GDP including oil and gas from Scottish waters came to 150 8bn in 2011 12 When Scotland is calculated to have its population share including offshore oil and gas it comes to 127 2bn But the SNP s other reckoning is that Scotland should have to pay less debt because oil and gas from under Scottish waters has contributed more in tax over the past 30 years On that basis it says Scotland should only have to take on 56bn which was 38 of GDP in 2011 12 That would take Scotland s debt levels to around those the UK had before the credit crunch The latest reckoning of Scotland s financial position is part of a report published called Scotland s Balance Sheet Parts of it were released earlier this week In these the Scottish government argued pension and welfare costs would be a smaller share of the Scottish economy than for the UK as a whole and most of western Europe A second portion of the report highlighted figures showing tax receipts per head have been higher than those of the UK for the past 30 years That offshore asset is calculated to give Scotland a GDP per head higher than the UK Scotland benefits from spending that is consistently 10 higher per person than the UK average Tax on oil and gas production would also have given an independent Scotland a higher tax take per head over the three decades Without offshore oil and gas Scotland s GDP is in a similar position to that of the UK as a whole and its share of taxes paid to the UK Treasury is thought to be slightly lower than that share of Scotland s population Nicola Sturgeon the deputy first minister said The mismanagement of the UK economy by Westminster has led to a situation where we are all burdened with a massive UK debt That is an argument for independence not against it Scotland s share of the UK s public sector debt will obviously be a crucial part of the negotiations following a vote for independence and this analysis shows that Scotland will be in a strong position in these negotiations The minister added It is clear that whatever way we look at it Scotland is in a much better financial position than the UK including on the issue of national debt Both of the methodologies show that Scotland s estimated share of national debt takes up a smaller proportion of our economy than is the case for the UK which means that in all circumstances Scotland will be better off with independence A spokesman for the UK Treasury said This is a partial analysis based on favourable assumptions and data from a year when North Sea receipts were particularly high Scotland benefits from spending that is consistently 10 higher per person than the UK average The independent IFS have explained that Scotland would face a much tougher fiscal challenge over the long term than the rest of the UK The Scottish government s own internal analysis acknowledges that North Sea receipts will fall dramatically over the coming decades This report doesn t explain how an independent Scotland would fill the black hole it will leave in its finances", "By Nick Britten 3 10PM BST 14 Apr 2013 Comments Prof Nutt said that too many bankers who took the drug were overconfident and so took more risks and said that not only did it lead to the current crisis in this country but also the 1995 collapse of Barings bank He said cocaine was perfect for their culture of excitement and drive and more and more and more adding Bankers use cocaine and got us into this terrible mess It is a more drug Prof Nutt is not a stranger to making controversial claims about drugs His latest attack is on the Government for absurd and insane laws dealing with magic mushrooms ecstasy and cannabis which he said were hindering medical research because regulations meant one of the ingredients psilocybin which is used to treat depression was so hard to get hold of He was sacked as the Government s most senior drugs advisor in 2009 after publishing a paper saying that there was not much difference between the harm caused by riding and ecstasy Society he argued did not always adequately balance all of the risks inherent in it He was ordered to apologise by the then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith who accused him of trivializing the dangers of taking drugs But he went on to claim that alcohol and tobacco were more dangerous than many illegal drugs including LSD ecstasy and cannabis and was fired after later criticizing the moral tone of the Government s policy making Banker died in front of model girlfriend after cocaine binge Whistleblower labelled Crazy Miss Cokehead City workers who supplied cocaine to bankers jailed Madam ran 1milion a year banker s brothel In his latest broadside Prof Nutt 61 professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London he said that magic mushrooms which were banned in 2005 were done so by the Conservatives to goad Tony Blair meaning he has to pay 6 000 for a license which was bonkers or face buying it on the streets which my ethics committee wouldn t allow He said The reason we haven t started the study is because finding companies who could manufacture the drug and who are prepared to go through the regulatory hoops to get the licence which can take up to a year and triple the price is proving very difficult The whole situation is bedevilled by this primitive old fashioned attitude that Schedule 1 drugs could never have therapeutic potential He told the Observer that being prevented on such grounds greatly hinders his research into evidence that psilocybin shuts down an area of the brain that is overactive in depression therefore potentially blocking negative thought patterns Prof Nutt also accused the coalition of having chickened out of minimum pricing on alcohol a move that has been proved in other countries to curb binge drinking Pathetic he said I mean the Lib Dems are sensible They support these policies", "By Graham Ruddick 10 00PM BST 13 Apr 2013 Comments For interested passers by the mysterious warehouse in eastern Santa Monica was described as a film studio Given that this was California the home of Hollywood this seemed a plausible explanation for the collection of people busily working on the building However the warehouse was not a film studio Inside the building a fully functioning dummy supermarket had been created The film studio story had been spread by the British company that was using the building for a top secret project That company was Tesco and their project was a new supermarket chain for the west coast of the US Tesco can China expansion pay dividends Five things Tesco sells in China but not in the UK Hilco in talks about securing HMV deal Gordon Brothers rescues Blockbuster Tesco halts new Fresh Easy stores in the US Sainsbury s and Tesco clash over price pledges More than 200 focus groups were invited to the store to provide feedback In order to stock the store with food while keeping their plans secret the company bought almost 70 000 46 000 worth of food from the east coast of the US and drove it back to California Meanwhile alongside the dummy store 50 senior Tesco directors lived with American families for two weeks The families who had been found by a market research firm had no idea who the British businessmen were or what they were doing as they shopped ate and relaxed with them However the behaviour of the families was being reported back to one of the world s leading retailers Sir Terry Leahy Sir Terry pictured below the then CEO wanted to know if there was an opportunity in the US for Tesco which by now was prospering in Budapest and Bangkok as well as Birmingham On February 9 2006 Tesco announced its intentions to the world The retailer said that following extensive consumer research it planned to roll out a new grocery chain in the US based on its successful Tesco Express convenience store concept in the UK These stores would be based on the west coast of the US and focus on fresh food According to Sir Terry the first stores would open in 2007 and the business would break even by the end of the second full year of operation The new business would be called Fresh Easy and it would cost the company 250m a year Even at the time the move was seen as brave perhaps even arrogant It was described as Sir Terry s biggest ever gamble The US retail landscape was littered with the ruins of failed attempts by UK companies to succeed there This included J Sainsbury which was forced to bail out of its Shaws business and Marks Spencer which in 2001 had to sell Brooks Brothers for a third of the price it paid for the chain Yet Tesco believed it could not just take on US rivals but do so with a completely new business In his book Management in 10 Words even Sir Terry admits that America has been a graveyard for UK retailers He writes There are indeed many cautionary tales to deter Britons especially retailers from setting up shop in the USA The lure is understandable A common language a culture that Britons feel they understand exposure to numerous American brands and companies who have invested in the UK Britons can easily delude themselves that life on the other side of the pond is not really that different and that competing there cannot be that hard Therein lies the problem These apparent similarities have blinded companies to the numerous differences According to Sir Terry Tesco instinctively knew that we should view America as foreign and we therefore began to look for differences If Fresh Easy did fail he added It will have been my responsibility as CEO and a clear example that goals are easy to set incredibly difficult to achieve and must carry a clear accountability Despite the substantial preparation by Tesco and Sir Terry s belief that Fresh Easy would succeed the company will confirm this week that the venture has failed and it will exit the US The failure will come at some cost Sir Terry said that starting from scratch meant Tesco was not betting the farm on succeeding in the US but the costs of pulling out will still be high According to sources close to the company Tesco will have to book a writedown of around 1bn to walk away from North America The bill will cover the value of Tesco s assets included wholly owned stores leases and a major distribution centre in Riverside California In addition Fresh Easy pictured below has built up almost 1bn of losses in the last six years and is still yet to make a profit Tesco may also have to pay redundancy costs for Fresh Easy staff if it fails to find a buyer These costs will lay bare the scale of Tesco s chastening experience in the US and add the company to the long list of UK failures in the country Clive Black analyst at Shore Capital said Fresh Easy certainly does not do the track record of British retailers taking the US by storm much good Tesco s expected exit arguably represents a degree of hubris by Tesco when it should have been paying more attention to matters in its own backyard The reasons for the failure of Fresh Easy include the downturn in the world economy since 2007 tough competition from the likes of Trader Joe s the expense of investing heavily in a distribution centre and kitchens after failing to find adequate suppliers and a misunderstanding of US customers such as using self service tills when customers felt more comfortable with shops assistants The failure of Fresh Easy is a blow to the reputation of Sir Terry particularly because it has also coincided with problems for the UK business Philip Clarke Sir Terry s successor has drawn a line under the US in order to focus the business on the UK and its success in Europe and Asia Since last January when Tesco was forced to issue its first profits warning in 20 years because of a drop in sales in the UK the patience of investors regarding Fresh Easy has eroded Whereas Fresh Easy earned time to develop under Sir Terry because of his spectacular track record the US business has run out of time under Clarke Sir Terry turned Tesco from the second biggest retailer in the UK behind Sainsbury s into the second biggest retailer in the world behind Walmart But in 2011 Clarke inherited a UK business which still accounted for 60pc of profits but was suffering from under investment in its stores As a result Clarke has been praised for ending the US distraction and focusing on turning around the UK When Clarke announced a strategic review of Fresh Easy in December ousting Tim Mason the US chief executive and Sir Terry s right hand man in the process shares in Tesco rose by more than 3pc Philip Dorgan analyst at Panmure Gordon said that when Tesco reports its annual results on Wednesday shareholders will be more interested in Clarke s plans for the UK business than the fact that the retailer will reveal its first fall in annual profits for 20 years What is important is that Tesco UK is on the road to recovery and management s blueprint for the future has enough of the vision thing to suggest that it will emerge as a winner from digital disruption he said The Tesco that emerges as a phoenix from the ashes will be completely different from its space hungry predecessor It will be relatively capital lite online focused cash generative and with a much higher return on capital employed Clarke pictured above has already unveiled his 1bn six point plan to revitalise Tesco in the UK The project is called Building a better Tesco It involves hiring more shop assistants refocusing stores on food rather than non food rebranding Tesco Value as the more aspirational Everyday Value and introducing 1 800 new products The early indications are that this plan is working with Tesco s like for like sales rising 1 8pc in the vital Christmas period However events since Christmas have proven the need for Clarke to build a wider long term vision for Tesco and its supermarkets in the UK Tesco s role in the horse meat crisis put the focus of customers back on the quality and provenance of food while the collapse of HMV brutally demonstrated the increasing domination of online shopping in non food Morrisons decision to launch an online food business proved how grocery shoppers are turning away from traditional supermarkets The supermarket industry in Britain is entering a new era Clarke called an end to the space race last year stating that the supermarket would cut net space growth by 38pc This was a pivotal moment for Tesco after two decades of rapid expansion that has seen the food chain founded by Jack Cohen in 1919 as a market stall in London s East End reach almost every UK postcode and account for 1 in every 8 spent in the retail sector Analysts at Nomura expect Clarke to talk this week about a further fall in capital expenditure from the 3 2bn committed this year and outline how spending will shift from traditional supermarkets into new retail channels Tesco s capex profile has already fallen from above 7pc to below 5pc of net sales on a five year view Nomura said We think the company s capex profile could moderate further although we are mindful of the necessity to invest in future proofing the UK portfolio eg more proximity stores online and optimising existing stores pursuing measured but valid growth opportunities overseas and the lag from committed projects With spending on new stores falling Clarke has started working on how Tesco can attract shoppers to its existing supermarkets and Tesco Extra hypermarkets by developing them into retail destinations Clarke s plan involves opening Giraffe restaurants which it owns and Harris Hoole coffee shops which it has a large stake in within Tesco supermarkets utilising space that was used for non food sales that have now moved online The Tesco Metro in London Bridge is an example of the modern Tesco store with an escalator from the street taking shoppers into a Euphorium bakery a salad bar for office workers and a health and beauty range Elsewhere in the UK Tesco is planning to install a Giraffe restaurant into its Tesco Extra in Watford while at King s Lynn it is developing a Dobbies Garden Centre which it also owns adjacent to a Tesco In Tesco s successful Asian business particularly South Korea and Thailand the idea of stores as retail destinations is the backbone of the business with many supermarkets developed as part of shopping centres Tesco is not about to become the new Westfield and build shopping centres across Britain but the retailer wants to boost footfall in its stores At the same time though Tesco is investing 750m 488m in digital technology this year three times more than in 2010 This includes taking on Amazon by adding music and books to its blinkbox service which allows customers to download film and television programmes over the internet This week Clarke will reveal more about his plans to reshape Britain s biggest retailer They are unlikely to include a film studio in California", "By Emily Gosden 10 15PM BST 13 Apr 2013 Comments In the starkest warning yet over the 14bn Hinkley Point project Lord Hutton chairman of the Nuclear Industry Association argues that failure would undermine Britain s credibility with investors and threaten other projects across the energy sector Writing in The Sunday Telegraph Lord Hutton also discloses that the industry has calculated cost savings of 20pc could be achieved for a second plant after Hinkley Point He says that 25pc of any price offered to EDF will go back to the Treasury through taxes Failure of the talks would also raise questions about EDF Energy s future in Britain The company s existing fleet of nuclear plants are mostly due to cease generating by early next decade Lord Hutton s intervention comes ahead of what is believed to be a key meeting tomorrow between senior executives of the French company and the Government s representatives Treasury minister Lord Deighton and energy department permanent secretary Stephen Lovegrove The talks focus on the so called strike price for electricity that the plant will generate which will be guaranteed for more than 30 years and subsidised through levies on consumer energy bills Olympics chief to bring nuclear power to UK EDF in big trouble says French nuclear expert New nuclear power stations face five year delay Nuclear plant gets green light but stalls on costs Why Britain must make nuclear work It is thought the two sides have yet to agree on acceptable costs for the project or the rate of return that French owned EDF should be granted The talks suffered another setback last week when a meeting between David Cameron and the French President Francois Hollande was cancelled because of the death of Baroness Thatcher Lord Hutton warns Time is of the essence EDF Energy has spent 1bn already and the project is at present costing the company 1m a day More than 100m has now been spent keeping the project ticking over since EDF s first agreement deadline of December was missed Henri Proglio chief executive of EDF said last week he now expected a decision within a month after another deadline of March was also missed Lord Hutton warns that failure to agree threatens not only the first new nuclear power station for a generation but potentially all those that will come in its wake He asks If a deal cannot be struck for new nuclear can it be struck for offshore wind or carbon capture and storage According to Whitehall sources the Government is trying to bear down on the costs of the project which are believed to be close to 14bn Ministers are attempting to balance the claims of the nuclear industry against those of EDF s critics who say a deal will lock consumers into paying billions of pounds of subsidies to the French state for decades Nuclear industry sources fear that the Treasury may be reticent to agree to subsidies because it sees gas as a cheaper alternative Lord Hutton argues The energy industry has been told that nuclear should be competitive with all forms of low carbon energy It is not reasonable to change the rules of the game at the last moment Left to its own devices the market would not choose to invest in capital intensive lowcarbon infrastructure This would lead us to a precarious high carbon future increasingly dependent on imported gas This would be absolutely the wrong direction for us to take and is why we must not lose sight of this in the current negotiations Lord Hutton suggests that as much as 3bn could be shaved off the costs for a second plant as the costs associated with it being

by the Pompey Supporters Trust can now be completed after the club spent 14 months in administration Their takeover is conditional on taking control of Fratton Park which was owned by Portpin Now the next chapter of hard work begins to transform our club into something the community of Portsmouth can be proud of Portpin led by Balram Chainrai claimed they were owed 12m by the club and held Portsmouth s home as security The PST had offered 3m for the ground but with Portpin unwilling to sell at that price administrators BDO went to the High Court to force the sale But it did not get that far with an agreement reached out of court between administrators and Portpin thought to be a figure of 3m plus add ons It means the fans group can now go ahead with their purchase of Fratton Park and BDO can start the process of finally bringing the club out of administration It s fantastic it s exactly the news we wanted It s really exciting PST chairman Ashley Brown told BBC Sport It s taken a lot longer than we wanted but in the end we got the result we wanted It s brilliant news we re over the moon Of course we believed it was possible otherwise we would not have put so much effort into it There have been times where we thought we would definitely do it and times where we thought we wouldn t Recently we ve been very bullish we ve kept at it and we were right to as we ve brought it home The belief kept us going we knew we were the right answer for the club and we all knew that we had to keep plugging away at what we wanted to achieve This moment should be something special for all fans not just Pompey This should give a belief of what is achievable We like to say we are the biggest community club in the country and we hope other clubs will follow This club now has a very bright future It is not going to be easy We re going down to League Two but we have to accept that and use it as an excuse to rebuild Administrator at BDO Trevor Birch added I m completely relieved My reaction is that relief that s is all finally over It s taken quite a bit out of me personally It s been a very difficult and complex case It s been hugely frustrating but at the end of the day it s all been worth it and Pompey are alive and kicking The club had been in danger of losing their Golden Share and effectively membership with the Football League who had warned Pompey they must come out of administration before the end of the season The PST have raised around 2m in pledges with fans donating 1 000 each to save the club They are also backed by several High Net Worth individuals who also support the club and they have bankrolled the Hampshire outfit for several months now One of those HNW s is Iain McInnes and he will become chairman of the club as and when the PST takeover is complete This was the second case to determine the future of Pompey with the initial hearing in December adjourned It marks the end of several torturous years for a club that has been in administration twice in three years and suffered relegation from the Premier League to the Championship and now League One With another 10 point penalty on the way a further relegation to League Two is expected On a day of drama at the High Court after two adjournments the case was finally heard and lasted only several minutes as Katharine Holland QC revealed an agreement in principle had been struck Holland asked for further time to seal the deal and after BDO returned at 15 00 BST several more adjournments followed before the judge declared it had been completed and the sorry saga was finally over It means Chainrai s four year hold on the club is at an end Birch will now start the process of bringing the club out of administration which is expected to be completed on 22 April", "The Post Office is to offer current accounts in the UK following a regulator s claim that the market offers little choice for consumers The new account provided by Bank of Ireland will be available in some areas in the coming weeks before a wider launch next year Few details have been released about the characteristics of the current account at this stage In January a regulator said the market was dominated by a few providers The Office of Fair Trading OFT said that Lloyds RBS Barclays and HSBC held 75 of the market This led to a lack of dynamism from the banks it said together with a lack of choice for customers meaning they were unlikely to switch to a different bank The Post Office which has 11 500 branches already offers a range of financial products in a link with Bank of Ireland Some three million Post Office customers already use products such as savings accounts mortgages and insurance policies Customers of nearly all the major UK banks are able to use post office counters for some services including depositing or withdrawing money from their non Post Office accounts It will be interesting to see whether this account will be as transparent and simple in structure as they suggest However Santander customers with the exception of its business customers and its Alliance and Leicester brand are unable to do so at all The Post Office has not released details of the account yet For example it has not said how much interest would be paid or whether there would be a charge for a packaged account We have carried out extensive research into the current account market and the findings tell us that customers want simplicity transparency and good value for money said Nick Kennett director of financial services at the Post Office Rachel Springall spokeswoman for financial information service Moneyfacts said that the new Post Office account could help to boost competition depending on how it was set up and what rewards it would offer customers The Post Office has a good High Street presence perfect for people who prefer the more personal branch banking It will be interesting to see whether this account will be as transparent and simple in structure as they suggest she said Kevin Mountford head of banking at comparison website Moneysupermarket said Until now most of these challenger accounts have been aimed at specific audiences The Post Office current account should have mass market appeal due to its large customer base and ease of access so I expect this account will be very popular Other new entrants to the UK current account market in recent times include Metro Bank in 2010 and M S Bank in 2012 Tesco Bank has also announced plans to launch an account soon However the OFT review of the 9bn market said that the newcomers were yet to be in a position to provide a significant challenge to the established providers Richard Lloyd executive director of consumer group Which said More competition is desperately needed to force banks to genuinely compete for customers But switching banks must also be made much easier and people will need to see real benefits from new providers to encourage them to move This is not the first time that a current account has been available at post offices The Girobank was set up by the General Post Office in 1968 and was the first to offer free accounts to individual customers It was taken over by Alliance and Leicester in 1990 and its name was dropped in 2003", "People changing jobs are losing track of their clutch of workplace pension pots making retirement planning more difficult a charity has said Age UK said that nearly a quarter of those asked in a survey were unaware of the state of at least one scheme About a quarter of the under 35s have already worked for about five employers a similar proportion to those aged 65 now A free service is provided by the government to trace lost pensions The survey asked 2 300 people about the whereabouts of their pension pots About one in five of those who said that their pension details were missing blamed lost paperwork The charity said that the issue was creating a pensions black hole It is really important we all set aside time to keep on top of our personal admin such as organising paperwork and keeping details of any financial products safe and secure said Lucy Harmer head of services at Age UK This is especially crucial for pensions as it may be some years down the line until they need to be accessed The problem may become increasingly acute as more and more workers are automatically enrolled into a workplace pension scheme under a new government regime Some 10 million extra people could be signed up to an occupational pension with every new job as a result The government is planning to make it easier for workers who change jobs frequently to take any small pension pot with them and merge it with their next workplace pension The Department of Work and Pensions also runs a pension tracing service that locates lost pensions for individuals It will then send details of the scheme provider s address to allow the policyholder to gather more information Malcolm McLean a consultant at actuarial firm Barnett Waddingham said Regular changes of jobs mean that individuals frequently accumulate a number of small pension pots which at some point they need to account for in preparation for retirement Having located all the pensions the individual should then consider bringing them together and purchasing a single annuity a retirement income It would normally give them a better return for their money than seeking to obtain a number of small annuities from different pension pots Getting the right type of annuity and shopping around for the best deal are also a must", "By Lord Hutton 10 15PM BST 13 Apr 2013 Comments Without power businesses cannot thrive and grow nor can individuals go about their daily lives Securing our energy supplies is vital to our national security Yet the provision of such a fundamental need in the UK is at risk at the very moment when electricity market reform is finally ready to give the country the secure reliable low carbon energy it needs for the future Protracted negotiations between the Government and EDF Energy for two new nuclear reactors in Somerset represent the first test of this policy which has been years in the making and has been underpinned by consistent political and public support Failure to reach agreement on the price of nuclear electricity threatens not only the first new nuclear power station for a generation but potentially all those that will come in its wake We must also ask the question if a deal cannot be struck for new nuclear can it be struck for offshore wind or carbon capture and storage Energy security at risk if ministers fail to seal EDF nuclear deal Olympics chief to bring nuclear power to UK EDF in big trouble says French nuclear expert New nuclear power stations face five year delay Nuclear plant gets green light but stalls on costs The effect of such a move should not be underestimated Not only would it have an impact on our future energy security but it would also undermine the international credibility of the UK as a country able to deliver the long promised policies needed to encourage investment Most immediately it risks what would be a significant contribution to jobs growth and a chance to rebuild the UK s industrial strength Compared with fossil fuel generation new nuclear costs are upfront which means more money spent on construction jobs now rather than on expensive imported fuel over many years Nor is it well understood that 25pc of the agreed price will come back to the public through taxes This economic benefit will only increase when we come to consider future nuclear projects such as Hinkley Point will serve as a platform on which to regenerate the country s industrial expertise Britain would again be well placed to compete globally as other countries develop their nuclear plans a market expected to be worth more than 1 trillion over the next 15 years But the key benefits will be felt by consumers Too many commentators have recently fallen into the trap of attempting to compare a future price for nuclear with the current wholesale cost of gas This is a wholly inappropriate comparison for a number of reasons First the current price of gas will not be the same when the next generation of nuclear reactors comes on stream in the early part of the next decade In particular it is clear that current prices for gas have been depressed by the economic slowdown Second current gas prices do not reflect the cost of carbon emissions Third they crucially discount the need for 110bn of capital investment in energy infrastructure in this country The energy industry has been told that nuclear should be competitive with all forms of low carbon energy This is the right comparison for us to be making in these discussions It is not reasonable to change the rules of the game at the last moment Left to its own devices the market would not choose to invest in capital intensive low carbon infrastructure This would lead us to a precarious high carbon future increasingly dependent on imported gas This would be absolutely the wrong direction for us to take and is why we must not lose sight of this in the current negotiations Once agreed the contract for difference can serve the twin aims of providing a fair return for investors and a fair price for consumers both for the cost of electricity generated as well as the upfront investment required Clearly the price must be politically acceptable Both government and industry have given cast iron guarantees that the details of the deal will be transparent and open to scrutiny It is in no one s interest for this deal to fall over at a later stage It must be seen to be fair to succeed Nuclear can and will provide a long term consistent guarantee that will protect consumers and ensure that energy bills will be less than would be the case if we do nothing In fact far from demonstrating the expense of nuclear the contracts for difference will ultimately reveal the competitiveness of nuclear generation when set alongside renewables Furthermore in establishing the conditions for a nuclear programme to follow it will create the conditions for other projects to be cheaper still by up to 20pc But time is of the essence EDF Energy has spent 1bn already and the project is at present costing the company 1m a day The company has already gained planning permission to build the first new nuclear power station in the UK for nearly two decades has already gained regulatory approval for the reactor design and has already gone through years of public engagement and consultation on how best to ensure the community prospers and benefits from this once in a generation opportunity There is a lot at stake If EDF Energy cannot strike a deal with the Government on a fair rate of return for this massive investment other energy projects will be at risk Given the necessary lead times for major infrastructure it will take decades to transform our energy mix and future generations will suffer There is no Plan B for our energy security Failure exposes Britain to many risks while success will help settle our energy future and send a strong signal to potential investors that Britain means business Lord Hutton of Furness is chairman of the Nuclear Industry Association", "UK based Hawk Eye is aiming to expand into other football leagues after agreeing a deal with the Premier League on Thursday Speaking to the BBC Hawk Eye inventor Dr Paul Hawkins said he had already agreed a deal with another European league but he did not name it The Premier League deal is expected to bring the company millions in extra revenues Dr Hawkins who is a director of the firm called the deal a proud moment It s a new sport and it s the biggest sport in the world he said With the Premier League alone we ll be doing 380 matches a year It s certainly been a deal we ve been working towards for a long time We started talking to the Premier League over six years ago The Hawk Eye camera system which Dr Hawkins invented more than ten years ago will be used to judge whether the ball has crossed the goal line in contentious incidents The system is already used extensively in cricket and tennis both in assisting referee decisions and to enrich television analysis More recently the BBC has also used Hawk Eye in its analysis of snooker matches Hawk Eye was bought by electronics giant Sony in 2011 but remains a relatively small company In 2009 it made profits of 1 1m on the back of sales worth 3 6m It would not say how much the Premier League deal is worth but reports suggest it could bring in as much as 10m over five years This would include the cost of installing the camera system at all 20 of next season s Premier League grounds as well as at Wembley Stadium The deal gives Hawk Eye the opportunity to expand into football despite missing out on the contract to supply the goal line technology for this summer s Fifa Confederations Cup Its German rival GoalControl was selected instead making them the favourite for the 2014 World Cup Other leagues and organisations have expressed a desire to introduce the technology The chief executive of Spain s La Liga has said he hopes to bring it in within the next two or three years But despite the promise of expansion Dr Hawkins acknowledged that Hawk Eye s application in football is limited and that the company would continue to develop its presence in other sports both as a tool of adjudication and analysis Unlike tennis or cricket Hawk Eye s use in football is limited to the rare occasions when there is a disputed goal There is also less opportunity for using Hawk Eye for in game analysis the original use of the system when it was launched as parts of Channel 4 s cricket coverage in 2001", "The empress has no clothes or at least not the clothes in which so many want to robe her Despite all the praise Mrs Thatcher did not arrest British economic decline launch an economic transformation or save Britain She did it is true re establish the British state s capacity to govern But then although she wanted to trigger a second industrial revolution and a surge of new British producers she used the newly won state authority to worsen the very weaknesses that had plagued us for decades The national conversation of the last six days has been based on a fraud If the Thatcher revolution had been so transformatory our situation today would not be so acute In the 20 years up to 1979 Britain s growth rate averaged 2 75 although it had been weakening during the ills of the mid 1970s In the years before the banking crisis there was a vexed debate about whether the Thatcher reforms essentially unchallenged by Blair and Brown had succeeded in restoring the long run growth rate to earlier levels Certainly the gap in per capita incomes between Britain France and Germany had narrowed as apparently had the productivity gap The question is whether any of it was sustainable Now there is a growing and dismaying recognition that too much growth in the past 30 years has been built on an unsustainable credit banking and property bubble and that Britain s true long run growth rate has fallen to around 2 The productivity gap is widening All that heightened inequality the unbelievable executive remuneration wholesale privatisation taking the shackles off business and labour market flexibility has achieved nothing durable This bitter realisation has been sharpening in non conservative circles for some months The pound has fallen by 20 in real terms since 2008 yet the response of our export sector to the most sustained competitive advantage since we came off the gold standard has been disastrously weak Britain s trade deficit in goods climbed to 6 9 of GDP in 2012 the highest since 1948 and February s numbers were cataclysmically bad Britain simply does not have enough companies creating goods and even services that the rest of the world wants to buy despite devaluation The legion of Mrs Thatcher s apologists argues she can hardly be blamed for what is happening 23 years after leaving office But economic transformations should be enduring shouldn t they Thatcherism did not deliver because dynamic capitalism is achieved through a much more subtle interplay She never understood that a complex ecosystem of public and private institutions is needed to support risk taking the creation of open innovation networks sustained long term investment and sophisticated human capital Believing in the magic of markets and the inevitable destructiveness of the state she never addressed these core issues Instead the demand for high financial returns steadily rose through her period of office along with executive pay even while investment and innovation sank And the trends continued because none of her successors dared challenge what she had started Instead her targets were trade unions and state owned enterprise in the ideological project of brutally asserting the primacy of markets and the private sector and thus a conservative hegemony in the name of a fierce patriotism This was real enough she really did want to put Britain back on the map economically and politically and the task force sailing for the Falklands embodied the intensity of that impulse But she did not pull it off as even she acknowledged in her more honest moments out of office Trade unions certainly needed the Thatcher treatment in terms of both accepting the rule of law and the need for responsibilities alongside their rights But companies shareholders banks and wider finance also needed this treatment But as her people and part of the hegemonic alliance she aimed to create they would never get the same medicine Instead her Big Bang in 1986 allowing banks worldwide to combine investment and commercial banking in London was a monster sweetheart deal to please her own constituency Britain became the centre of a global financial boom but at home this meant an intensification of the financial system s dysfunctionality helped by little regulation and a self defeating credit boom worsening the anti investment short termist that needed to be reformed This is now obvious to all But for nearly 30 years the apparent success of Thatcherism hid the need However in one serious respect trade unions were a proper target By the late 1970s a handful of trade union leaders in effect co ran the country the beneficiaries of the failure of successive governments to bring free collective bargaining into a legal framework This despite the fact that they could not deliver their members to agreed policies and the third year of an incomes policy had collapsed On this question the Labour party was intellectually exhausted and politically bankrupt the Conservative government under Heath had been defeated too It had become a first order crisis of governability even of democracy This was her opportunity and she seized it The early employment acts and the victory over Arthur Scargill s NUM decisively reaffirmed that the fount of political power in the country is Parliament at the time a crucial intervention But she wildly overshot Trade unions within a proper framework are a vital means of expressing employee voice and protecting worker interests Labour market flexibility code for deunionisation and removal of worker entitlements has become another Thatcherite mantra that again hides the complexity of what is needed in the labour market employee voice and engagement skills and adaptability When she left office 64 of UK workers had no vocational qualifications The best thing that can be said about Thatcherism is that it may have been a necessary if mistaken staging post on the way to our economic reinvention She resolved the crisis of governance but then demonstrated that simple anti statism and pro market solutions do not work We need to do more sophisticated things than control inflation reduce public debt roll back the state and assert market forces The coalition government is developing new look industrial strategies reforming the banking system and reintroducing the state as a vital partner into areas such as energy New thinking is emerging everywhere For example in the north east of England an economic commission chaired by Lord Adonis of which I was a member recently recommended the de facto reintroduction of the metropolitan authority in Newcastle abolished by Mrs Thatcher It would co ordinate a pan north east redoubling of investment in skills and transport along with winning more investment And it wants the local economic partnership to work in the same building as the proposed new combined authority driving forward an innovation and investment revolution This complex interaction of private and public the commission is trying to develop is a world away from Thatcher and widely welcomed The empress really has no clothes Wednesday s funeral is a tribute to the myth and the conservative hegemony she created If the royal family is concerned as is reported that the whole affair will be over the top they are right Mrs Thatcher capitalised on a moment of temporary ungovernability that to her credit she resolved then sold her party and country an oversimple and false prospectus The landslide Mr Blair won in 1997 was to challenge it but he did not understand at the time nor understand now what his mandate meant The force of events is at last moving us on But Britain has been weakened rather than strengthened by the revolution she wreaked This article will be opened for comments on Sunday morning", "The pros and cons of cutting out an estate agent For thousands of people the start of spring means the beginning of the house hunting season It is also time to ponder one of life s unanswered questions How do estate agents have the cheek to charge a king s ransom for selling a house If that is your view have you thought of trying to sell it yourself This year that should become easier as the government is changing the rules on selling houses over the internet Private sale websites that help you find a buyer for your property will be given new freedom to operate As a result sellers could save thousands of pounds But is it really a good idea or could you end up wasting rather than saving money Selling your house DIY style means exactly that When you sign up with a private sale website they will send you a For Sale sign with your phone number on it to erect outside your house Get used to the graft of banging the sign into the ground because from now on the task is only going to get harder I think that an estate agent is a service that I can do You take the photographs you show potential buyers round the property you organise Energy Performance Certificates EPC s and above all you negotiate on price with any potential buyer In return for the website posting your photos and matching you with buyers you will pay anything from 300 to 600 At the higher end of that price range your property details will also be advertised on the big portals like Rightmove and Zoopla which dominate the market Some sellers like David Dexter are ecstatic at the potential savings on offer I think that an estate agent is a service that I can do And I think it s a really great opportunity to get the house out to as many people as possible And essentially to save a lot of money he explains He is selling a three bedroom house near Reading in Berkshire for 265 000 His local estate agent quoted a fee of around 4 800 including VAT But he has opted to pay 600 for a premium service with The Little House Company one of many private sale websites If he manages to sell it he will therefore save himself over 4 000 Estate Agencies are having to defend their reputations like never before They point out that selling a house is only a small part of the service they offer Selling the house is the easy bit says Mark Hayward of the National Association of Estate Agents Much more difficult is dealing with the offer checking the chain and talking to lawyers he says Many estate agents will try and establish whether potential buyers are who they say they are and whether they can really afford to buy your house In particular they say price negotiation is a skill that many people think they have but in reality do not Peter Bolton King of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS says private sale websites offer a totally different level of service to that of an estate agent There is a huge difference between paying a few hundred pounds just to put the property on to the internet compared with all of the services that should be provided and the security that should be offered by the good traditional local estate agent he told the BBC Estate agents are also members of the Property Ombudsman scheme which provides for financial compensation should things go wrong For anyone thinking of selling privately the key question is how many houses have actually been sold through such websites Houseweb which has been going for 17 years claims to have sold 15 000 homes over that time But some of the other websites the BBC tried to contact were not so forthcoming with figures One of the best known did not return our calls This may be because the current legal limitations prevent them operating effectively When the law that defines an estate agent is changed later this year these private websites will be relieved of certain obligations placed on estate agents like having to visit the property concerned The government hopes the greater freedom they then will enjoy will allow them to flourish and the market to grow In the United States it is thought around 10 of house sales are carried out through private sale websites RICS estimates that the equivalent figure for the UK is currently around 5 which suggests that de regulation could make a significant difference The danger for sellers is that they may pay several hundred pounds to a private sale website but still fail to find a buyer If they then resort to an estate agent they will have spent more money not less One alternative is to use an online estate agency instead They tend to have a larger reach and so attract a larger number of potential buyers Ask yourself whether anyone looking for property in your area is really going to be able to find it on the internet Maybe do a web search in the area and see which property site comes up first Or consider a private sale alongside an estate agent sale But be careful to get the agreement right with the agent in case you end up selling privately but still paying the agent If you get the contract right if you re absolutely up front with both sides you could advertise privately but then you can also work through an estate agent as well advises Kate Faulkner of the website Propertychecklists But you need to get the contract absolutely watertight to make sure you don t end up paying both fees Even if most house sellers fail to embrace the new websites the forthcoming deregulation could still end up changing the market Some believe that estate agents may be forced to introduce fixed fees for their services rather than taking an average 1 5 commission That could be particularly advantageous for those with larger properties who historically have faced steeper bills from estate agents", "US authorities have filed criminal and civil charges against a former senior partner at accountancy giant KPMG over alleged insider trading It is claimed that Scott London passed information to a golfing friend who then traded on the share tips KPMG resigned earlier this week as auditor to US companies Herbalife and Skechers after claims about its Los Angeles based partner emerged
