["Prisoner Soul R4 iPlayer Solos on Loneliness R4 iPlayer Steve Lamacq Lammo Celebrates 20 Years at the BBC 6 Music iPlayer An absorbing programme yesterday in the nicest of Radio 4 slots 10 30 11am on a Saturday nice that is if you re having a leisurely post lie in breakfast I dream of those Prisoner Soul was about a brief weird anomaly in the 1970s when the US prison system allowed and in some cases encouraged prisoners to form bands and incredibly release records If you think prisons are a soft option imagine the furore if that were to happen now Never mind the fuss about Ding Dong The Witch is Dead what if Please Release Me Set Me Free or worse That s the Way Uhuh Uhuh I Like It by the Wormwood Scrubbies got to No 1 The Daily Mail would explode into a thousand million pieces and the amount of frenzied internal BBC emails would break the internet Anyway it happened Prisoner Soul tracked down those involved in two projects one in Texas and one in New Jersey The Texas project was run by Harley Rex who set up a recording studio in the Wynne Unit We heard from him and John Indo who played trumpet on Behind the Walls by the Outlaws It was all very legit the band practised from 8am till lunch then did paperwork all afternoon From New Jersey we met singer Reginald Haynes whose route to recording was a little different His band won a prison talent contest we were the cat s miaow and in the audience was George Kerr producer of the O Jays Kerr lobbied the prison until he was allowed to bring in a portable recording studio They recorded in the sex offenders wing because the cells were soundproofed We heard decent snatches of the resulting record All We Need Is Another Chance by the Escorts and it was lovely sweet almost Philly sounding soul with great trumpets and harmonies The Texas recordings were similar with even better brass Now they re collectors items but at the time they were just good records and so got played on the radio Haynes recalled when they heard the Escorts on free world wireless The whole yard stopped he said We couldn t believe it I couldn t either quite It s sad to think that budget cuts and hardline attitudes about how prisoners should spend their time mean that such records will never be made or heard again Quite an offbeat one for Radio 4 that one as was Solos on Loneliness on Tuesday morning A deceptively simple format just interviews with no presenter Solos asked lonely people a bit about themselves One of the interviewees was Andy Kershaw slotted in with no more status than anyone else in the programme He explained matter of factly that many of his friends disappeared when his marriage broke down and then his friend John Walters producer of John Peel s shows died Kershaw felt thoroughly lonely It sounds rather as though he still does he doesn t feel as though he has anyone to share the stuff of life with Other interviewees were the same a young woman whose partner left her when their child was just months old a beautifully spoken lady who missed her husband of 40 years Their stories wove in and out The cumulative effect was touching oddly dreamlike background music wafted like the tide and very personal There was some discussion about contemporary life whether it has made us more isolated but the fact is we ve all felt lonely at some point And if we haven t we will as one of the speakers pointed out Steve Lamacq on Friday was far from lonely celebrating his 20 years at the BBC with various surprise guests including Jarvis Cocker Gaz Coombes Frank Turner his old radio mucker Jo Whiley and Chris Martin on the phone Plus the local pub landlord Frank from the Ship turned up with a pint It was all very sweet and very deserved Lamacq is the hardest working man in indie never happier than when he s bashing about in a transit van or nursing a beer at the back of a gig He ploughs his own dedicated un celebby furrow devoted to the simple idea of finding great guitar music and bringing it to his listeners Good for him But crikey 20 years Cheers to that Steve and here s to 20 more", "Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead has failed to reach the number one spot in the music charts The Wizard of Oz song which has been at the centre of an online campaign by opponents of Baroness Thatcher reached number two after selling 52 605 copies However it was still more than 5 700 copies behind Duke Dumont and A M E with Need U 100 which remained at the top for a second week Rival campaign song I m In Love With Margaret Thatcher entered at 35 The 1979 song by punk band Notsensibles sold 8 768 copies after a late push from Lady Thatcher fans The Official Charts Company said Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead was one of the most controversial chart contenders of all time following the death of Lady Thatcher last week On Friday Radio 1 controller Ben Cooper said in his BBC blog he had decided Sunday s Official Chart Show would not play the 51 second song in full He said the decision had been a difficult compromise saying he had to balance respect for someone who had just died with issues around freedom of speech Instead host Jameela Jamil linked to a Newsbeat reporter who explained why the song was in the chart Two short clips of the song were played as Sinead Garvan gave details of the online campaign and explained why opponents had been critical of Lady Thatcher The news report which ran for almost 40 seconds longer than the song itself also included two views from members of the public on the controversy with one saying it was quite funny while the other said it was disgraceful The Notsensibles track was played in full on the programme although Jamil did not introduce the song The band was later mentioned as a new entry in the chart recap for songs 40 to 31 however the title was not named Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude who is overseeing Lady Thatcher s funeral arrangements described the campaign to get Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead to the top of the charts as extremely trivial I just think that doing it in the wake of an old lady s death doesn t reflect terribly well on us he told BBC Radio 5 live s Pienaar s Politics Aside from the controversy Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead has become the first sub 60 second single to ever make the top 10 The song charted at number nine on the Big Top 40 chart broadcast on commercial radio stations Like Radio 1 the programme featured a short clip as part of a news report explaining the chart entry Elsewhere in the official singles chart Pink s Just Give Me A Reason featuring Fun s Nate Ruess went down a place to number three with Pompeii by Bastille at four and Feel This Moment by Pitbull featuring Christina Aguilera climbing three places to five In the album chart Paramore s self titled fourth album ended Justin Timberlake s three week stint at number one outselling it by two copies to one Pink s The Truth About Love was at three while Emeli Sande s Our Version Of Events climbed three places to number four The album has now spent 61 weeks in the top 10", "Aca scuse me Variously pitched as Glee with teeth and X Factor meets Mean Girls Pitch Perfect 2012 Universal 12 more closely resembles an anarchic mash up of High School Musical and Best in Show with a hint of Heathers and a smattering of Stick It thrown in for good measure Anna Kendrick is the indie spirited newbie at college where organised nerd singing is the new so uncool it s cool sensation From the moment we see the prim leader of the all girl vocal group projectile vomiting in the middle of an Ace of Bass tribute you know this isn t going to be a well behaved affair What follows is a tale of heats and heartbreaks torment and Treblemakers nobility and nodes they sit on your windpipe and they crush your dreams a cheese cutting satire which delivers a consistent spewy stream of laughs screams and cackles Stealing the show is rising star Rebel Wilson as the force of nature who calls herself Fat Amy so twig bitches like you don t do it behind my back with strong support from the likes of co producer Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins as the waspy commentating duo from hell Add to this a weirdly affectionate subplot about falling for the nostalgia of The Breakfast Club and Pitch Perfect shapes up as a surprisingly sassy close harmony comedy which hits all the high and low notes Amid the aca madness of Pitch Perfect by far the weirdest element is Hana Mae Lee s Lilly a barely audible presence who augments her singing chores with whispered admissions that I light fires to feel joy and I ate my twin in the womb Compared with Lilly the shouty sweary caricatures of Seven Psychopaths 2012 Momentum 15 seem positively mundane Colin Farrell is the blocked writer attempting to finish the eponymous life affirming screenplay surrounded by a menagerie of dog napping gun toting crazies played with relish by Sam Rockwell Christopher Walken Woody Harrelson Tom Waits et al Having been lazily compared to Quentin Tarantino in the past writer director Martin McDonagh here lives up to the tag more s the pity While In Bruges boasted breathtakingly audacious black comedy Seven Psychopaths wants to have eat and shoot its cake in the face settling all too often for knowing self referentiality just because someone says your women characters are lousy does that actually justify them being so While Charlie Kaufman spun strange surreal gold from a similar premise in Adaptation McDonagh sometimes seems as creatively stifled as his bedraggled antihero Of course there are pleasures to be had from the frequently scabrous turns of phrase of which the ripe rogues gallery make the most but the laughter rings rather hollow In The Spirit of 45 2013 Dogwoof E Ken Loach reminds us of a period in which Labour won an election on a socialist ticket and built a postwar dream based on national health and nationalised industry There s some extraordinarily moving first hand testimony from those who lived through squalor conflict and hardship to witness the rebuilding of a new world which is now all but forgotten As a living document of a time which now seems like another country this is stirring stuff which deserves to be seen in homes and schools alike Richard Hawley s lonely voice and chiming guitar lend the perfect backdrop to the neo noir ambience of I Anna 2012 Artificial Eye 15 in which a detective Gabriel Byrne investigating a murder is unprofessionally distracted by a melancholic singles club devotee Charlotte Rampling While the overworked plot doesn t quite surprise at it intends Barnaby Southcombe s stylish thriller makes great use of its London and Southend locations and conjures an air of enigmatic unease May I Kill U 2012 Cyclops 15 is depressing homegrown fare a nasty unfunny Death Wish satire aimed at bored teenagers who will find its social networking gimmick so last year Kevin Bishop is the policeman who gets pushed off his bike by a hoodie and turns into an internet avenger getting loads of likes for his uploaded snuff movies The titular twist is that the killer asks his victims if he can kill them after half an hour of this the answer yes please leapt to mind", "Picture this after saving humanity from the aggressive forces of the Locust Hordes in hit shooter Gears of War grizzled gun toting hero Marcus Fenix sweeps team mate Dom Santiago into a tender embrace and the pair kiss passionately as the credits roll It s fantasy of course Not only in the context of the imaginary worlds that provide much of video gaming s currency but also in the uncomfortable reality that would make such a relatively innocuous event almost unthinkable in a game released today Fenix is inevitably in a heterosexual relationship within the game a snapshot of the underwhelming job the industry is doing of presenting the diversity of its audience in the titles it produces The majority of game protagonists are still straight white and male whereas the audience is increasingly more diverse explains Mitu Khandaker independent developer at The Tiniest Shark Besides the question of who developers perceive their audience to be game protagonists are simply not representative enough of people in the real world she adds Unfortunately a disappointingly overwhelming amount of the time non white female or LGBT characters in games do little more than parrot existing media stereotypes particularly within mainstream games Khandaker touches on an important point as video games have begun to mature as an art form they have adopted the same lazy cliches that long dominated film and television Women are often to be rescued or ogled non white characters are sidekicks or villains gay people are invisible or caricatures However games are still at a stage in their development comparable to the movie industry of the 1930s As cinema grew and matured slowly tackling more complex themes and appealing to wider audiences so too must gaming challenge its own inherent biases Part of the problem may be the players themselves or at least a segment of the player base that is vocally resistant to change Mainstream fan communities tend to be overly hostile when diversity issues are brought up and I feel that they tend to get much more hostile and abusive when the person bringing up the issue is a member of a minority demographic says Regina Buenaobra North American online community team leader for Guild Wars developer ArenaNet Games are meeting the needs of straight white male gamers but when others say that their needs aren t being met they just can t empathise A market that doesn t cater to them is beyond their experience To larger publishers dealing with high budget titles carrying considerable financial risk this creates a mixed message the familiar core audience seemingly decrying change while an untapped one demands visibility Without speaking for others I think there s a fear of exclusion rather than an appreciation for the opportunity for inclusion says Noah Hughes creative director on the recently rebooted Tomb Raider They might be losing people by making these choices as opposed to flipping it around and seeing that you can invite more people to have these experiences The issue of representation has drawn increasing focus over the last 12 months from those working in the industry At last month s Game Developers Conference in California the subject was a key talking point Microsoft s Tom Abernathy went as far as stating that women are the new core and called for greater diversity in games saying Our industry our art and our business stand to gain in every sense simply by holding a mirror up to our audience and reflecting their diversity in what we produce Promisingly parts of the mainstream industry are already heading in that direction Telltale Games episodic adaptation of The Walking Dead won near universal acclaim last year for its emotional clout and sympathetic cast including black lead Lee Everett and developers at Sony s Naughty Dog studio fought for co lead Ellie to be prominently featured on box art for forthcoming post apocalyptic thriller The Last of Us Elsewhere Capcom s impending sci fi action title Remember Me introduces Nilin a mixed race woman I want to keep faith in humanity and in the fact that gender doesn t matter when a protagonist is created Remember Me s creative director Jean Maxime Moris says We are in 2013 It is high time game companies noticed what has been happening in other forms of storytelling in the past couple of thousands of years In the world and the story of Remember Me the only choice we had was to go with Nilin We didn t consider having a male character and we hope she resonates well with players from all ages and countries The calls for diversity in games have never been greater and though smaller independent studios are better positioned to capitalise the bigger more monolithic companies are likely to find it harder to ignore the demand It may be a while yet before a mainstream shooter is bold enough to subvert macho expectations with a gay lead but the visibility of types other than the straight white male is increasing and that can only be a good thing for the industry the medium and of course the players The Longest Journey Funcom 2000 presents leading lady April Ryan a directionless young artist as an intelligent flawed and realistic human being April s fantasy adventure also explores themes of youth responsibility and growing up Of note is the game s portrayal of supporting characters Fiona and Mickey a pair of middle aged lesbians in a committed relationship Its sequel Dreamfall Funcom 2007 introduced new heroes Zo Castillo a young woman of mixed Chinese and Spanish descent and Kian Alvane a black apostle raised in a matriarchal religious society while further exploring April s destiny On the surface Catherine Atlus 2011 seems to be little more than Japanese fanservice but look closer and you ll find a mature exploration of sex obsession and psychosis that also presents one of the few transgender characters in games Although waitress Erica s birth gender isn t mentioned until the end of the game the revelation paints other characters interactions with her throughout the game in a different light reflecting the real fears and stigmas trans people face Half Life 2 Valve 2004 and its own sequels featured Alyx Vance another woman of dual heritage here Afro Asian A scientific genius and determined survivor in the wake of an alien invasion the only disappointment is that she isn t a playable character More recently Prototype 2 Radical Entertainment Activision 2012 introduced James Heller a black male hero who wasn t an aspiring criminal or slogan quoting urban stereotype but a desperate man out to save his wife and daughter Perhaps more interestingly the game recasts Alex Mercer the white lead of the first Prototype as the mad villain Heller must overcome", "In the painful days after Saul s death I resolved to keep my grief private But as I listened to yet more parvenus such as the in all senses diminutive Martin Amis seek to claim my father as their own I felt a need to put a halt to the absurd conflation of literary figure and family man These self appointed self serving narratives described a deified figure I didn t recognise Saul was an intensely private man who would have hated to see his shortcomings ruthlessly exposed But tough he was a mean cantankerous old sod and it s about time I got some emotional and financial payback As a psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapist of some 40 years standing you might have expected me to adopt a holistic approach to understanding my father But I have found it much more helpful to divide his life into two the Young Saul who loved me greatly and was generally a good bloke and the Old Saul who found it hard to show how much he loved me and was generally a bit of a shit This way I don t need to make sense of why he appeared to have a complete personality change Or indeed examine the more troubling possibility that he never did care for me and that I and the rest of his family were inconvenient physical manifestations of his narcissism The Young Saul was born in Canada in 1915 and though his father was consistently abusive and his brothers bullied him he came to look on his early years as a very paradise as even the most simplistic reading of Herzog will show you The Bellow family moved to the coalyards of Chicago in 1924 where a loss of innocence ignited Saul s desire to be a world famous writer when he met Anita they embarked on the Gypsy Years Saul loved Anita greatly though his leftwing views forced him to rebel against petit bourgeois monogamy by shagging almost every woman he met I was born in 1944 and I clearly remember him saying My life is complete now I have a first born son as I appeared from the cosy warm embrace of Anita s womb Following my appearance Saul s literary genius took wing and with The Adventures of Augie March he found a wealth and success that allowed him to leave my mother and have sex with even more women Before long Saul had got remarried divorced remarried again divorced again remarried yet again and divorced yet again The reason I see so little of you he would say is that my love for you is so intense that were we to meet more often my heart would explode with joy How I enjoyed the 10 minutes I spent with Young Saul when he reluctantly invited me to Oslo for the Nobel prize ceremony an award he never felt he deserved and it is with great fondess I recall us discussing the failure of his Reichian therapy Such was the greatness and intensity of Saul s writing during this period and it was with great reluctance that he changed the title of Greg s Gift to Humboldt s Gift that he failed to notice I had got married and had children Yet still I felt a unique filial bond between myself and the Young Saul All this changed when he met Janis a mere teenager with whom he had a daughter Now he became Old Saul a bitter and twisted demented mean old conservative who cast aside his old family and in whose last book Ravelstein it is clear that all his works were nothing but thinly disguised second rate autobiography a lashing out at all those whom he truly loved Yet somehow now I have completed my own book I feel reconnected to the father whom I truly loved and who loved me more than anyone else The hatred and misunderstanding is past The skies are clear I forgive you Father for you know not what you did Digested read digested Oedipus

Steve Lamacq believes we are now tuned out when it comes to homegrown music Speaking to the Independent on Sunday Lamacq said I think we ve had a bit of a history in Britain of ignoring our own music at times It happened during grunge and again now Lamacq puts this neglect down to an increasing obsession with the US music scene and the British media s focus on US blogs to find out what s being touted stateside I think around places like Hull Sheffield York and further north through Manchester and up to Scotland I m sure there are things going on but the spotlight s not being shone there

the National Theatre Designed by the outstanding theatre architects Hawarth Tompkins it will provide a temporary performance space while the theatre s smallest auditorium the Cottesloe is closed during the NT s 70 million redevelopment programme Just the sight of it makes you smile It looks like a miniature version of Battersea Power Station with its four ventilation towers and it has been ingeniously incorporated into the NT s existing architecture with a large foyer and direct access from the main building The aim is to provide space for a wide variety productions and to give the NT a chance to take some risks Some shows will run for two months others for just a couple of days and the building has been inaugurated in style by Tanya Ronder s highly inventive and often touching new play Table which suits the new space perfectly not least because the building itself resembles an upturned table The dining table in the play belongs to the Best family and we see it being passed down through six generations from the time when a Lichfield carpenter called David Best made it to celebrate his marriage in 1898 right up to 2013 when a very modern fractured family of their descendants sit round it Rufus Norris s superbly inventive and deeply felt production is full of old hymns bruising confrontations quirky humour and sudden surprises The action begins and ends in present day London but moves backwards to Lichfield in the 19th century and later takes diversions to Tanganyika in the 1950s and a hippie commune in Herefordshire in the 1960s Hytner s genius was to free us actors Guide to Nicholas Hytner s top ten shows National Theatre director to step down There is a great deal of humour not least the wonderfully unexpected sequence involving a nun and a big game hunter in Africa but Ronder s play is also dark sharply depicting the sad human truth that we often inflict the worst pain on those we love or are supposed to love A cracking cast of nine play 23 characters between them with especially fine work from Paul Hilton doubling as a father and his deeply troubled son and Rosalie Craig as a young nun whose life takes an entirely unexpected course As the play progresses the audience is made constantly aware of the way people are both shaped and damaged by their parents The storytelling is satisfyingly complex and sturdily held together by the table itself originally made with love and bearing the marks and scars of more than a century of family vicissitudes This is a great start to a fascinating new venture for the NT Until May 18 Tickets

For years and for selfish childish reasons I didn t really want to review Mad Men It was about Madison Avenue in the 1960s when there were slightly fewer colours in the world but those that there were were somehow more vibrant The men got to wear properly cut suits with shorter jackets and longer trousers with pleats creased just so They wore slim square watches that told you the time rather than sang to you to tell you it was raining because they were grown up men They lived in impossibly sexy Bauhaus cartoon penthouses with impossibly sexy Vargas cartoon wives They said and thought clever things often and often even more cleverly after having started in on the Chivas at what weaker eras call coffee time and smoked all the time and apart from the casual for which read avid professional misogyny it was all rather wonderful Of course I didn t want to review it I wanted to be in it But that was just the mood and the look just the surface lovely as it was As time went by even slugabed jealous idiots such as me began to realise all that was actually negligible we were simply watching a magnificently written saga of our times of the toxicity of minor daily betrayals the postwar angst and occasional redemptions of the whole American 60s social supernova scripted in fast italic and shot on Leica By the third series it was clear that while we d concentrated wrongly on the cigarettes for a while what we were really being shown was all the ash underfoot The sixth series kicked off promising many similarly wonderful lost hours ahead over coming weeks Don Draper opened this double bill on a Waikiki beach in 1967 all blue drinks on white sands and it wasn t long before in a scene in a night beachside bar in which he met a demi drunken GI he had managed somehow with only about seven slow well spaced lines to remind us where he really was trapped in the sanitised misery of a perfect marriage and haunted a little by his having appropriated all those years ago a dead soldier s identity to come home reborn and become the fast melting colossus he is No dog tags here but now a misplaced army Zippo which now dangles before us and him does it Oh please as a promise finally to send him on if not a quest then certainly on a serious internal rummage and maybe yes some final grimed and ash streaked redemption We also got after a quietly hilarious quietly awful funeral scene his mentor Roger pausing between the shooting of all those snow white cuffs to remind us all how unsurprised and frankly unbothered he was by the death of his 90 year old mother and matriarch At the very end he paused impatiently on his way into his office to pick up the old shoeshine kit sent over by the family of Giorgio who had done his leather all those years but had just died He shut the door half heartedly opened the box and took out an old black battered brush Stared at it and crumpled Buckled Wept like a baby Not a word was spoken but his mother All those years All those guilts and strivings All the success All the pain All the 60s All the women and all the lack of love It was simple magnificent and shot with a Hitchcockian punch to the gut I found last Monday night s coverage of Mrs Thatcher s death rather good BBC ITV and Channel 4 all had prepared tributes of which Jon Snow s Maggie Me was the most fun and perhaps the most insightful it s worth watching again But none was too cloying all covered the bases with sure feet and we were left with several reasonably solid impressions which as the week hurtled on with history being rewritten in increasingly shrill voices wouldn t actually have been a bad way to leave it An actress basically who milked her minutes on the world stage for all she could even though much of it would have happened anyway At home a little more human than we d realised but not much Impossibly energetic deeply clever or at least shrewd courageous until petulant and those early days of a shocked goggling all male cabinet apparently from 1842 must indeed have been grim work and in the end hobbled by an almost sociopathic lack of empathy either when she was humiliating old Howe in the end days or throughout failing in her Christian way even to understand let alone forgive anyone who didn t want to become in even a small way an entrepreneur She also it emerged again quietly had precisely no sense of humour whatsoever None This in Britain is actually rather extraordinary I wonder why the link between lack of empathy and lack of humour has not been further explored Matthew Parris wise old Ken Clarke and a nicely courteous Ken Livingstone popped up on most and were the best and I would have happily watched the whole lot again but for the preening ubiquity of Cecil Parkinson his impossibly pink cheeks still as smooth as a baby s arse and still as full of crap Talking of humour ha ITV rolled out something called Off Their Rockers in which ageing actors spoofed young members of the public The joke was that it s funny to see an old person saying a sex word or farting Every gag was about fungus dog poo haemorrhoids or sex The message was that that s all people over 70 do fart and have fungus and step in dog poo and widdle and die and that it would be funny to watch young people being shocked at them doing it The young spoofed came out of it very well tolerant and kind and not one of them cruel The cruelty was all self inflicted on actors and on the whole woeful production At one stage an oldish biddy acted even older on a bus croaking to a bemused teen Do you think I m too old at 78 to stand up My parents are about that age and they stand up straight for at least eight whole hours a day every day No need it s just their thing Sometimes just in the middle of the street though it s best when they can get

travelled to the secretive state last month with members of a London School of Economics student society The university has said the genuine students on the trip had been deliberately misled by the BBC and were put in serious danger by the presence of the BBC team It said Sweeney who graduated from the university in 1980 had passed himself off as a current PhD student It has accused the Corporation of taking an unacceptable risk Had the journalists identity been discovered by the North Korean authorities the entire group could have been arrested and faced punishment The journalists travelled to the country with members of the LSE s Grimshaw Club which was established in 1923 and is part of the International Relations Department While in North Korea the Panorama team filmed undercover footage that will be broadcast in North Korea Undercover on BBC One on Monday North Korea rejects talks with South Questions over BBC s Panorama defence North Korea Seoul in the shadow of aggression BBC entirely reckless over Panorama Analysis China s limited options to tame unruly North Korea LSE professors at risk over BBC s film on North Korea The Corporation has said the programme will go ahead despite the university asking for it to be withdrawn It insists students on the trip were aware of the BBC s presence before travelling to North Korea This weekend LSE officials sent a letter to all members of the university deploring the tactics used by the BBC to get its journalists into North Korea It said The School wishes to alert all staff and students to a serious development which may affect them personally in future This relates to the conduct of the BBC in respect of a Panorama programme entitled North Korea Undercover which is due to be shown next Monday evening 15 April The programme has been produced using as cover a visit to North Korea which took place from 23 30 March 2013 in the name of the Grimshaw Club a student society at LSE The School authorities had no advance knowledge of the trip or of its planning The letter said the visiting party included John Sweeney Alexander Niakaris and Tomiko Sweeney It went on In advance of the trip it was not known to the rest of the party that they were three journalists working for or with the BBC Their purpose posing as tourists was to film and record covertly during the visit in order to produce the Panorama programme It added LSE s chief concerns are twofold First at no point prior to the trip was it made clear to the students that a BBC team of three had planned to use the trip as cover for a major documentary to be shown on Panorama BBC staff have admitted that the group was deliberately misled as to the involvement of the BBC in the visit The line used was that a journalist would join the visit BBC staff have argued that this lack of frankness in denying the genuine members of the group the full details was done for their own benefit in the event of discovery and interrogation by North Korean authorities It is LSE s view that the students were not given enough information to enable informed consent yet were given enough to put them in serious danger if the subterfuge had been uncovered prior to their departure from North Korea BBC staff asserted in a meeting with LSE management on 9 April 2013 that the BBC had undertaken its own risk assessment in advance of the trip which had been approved at the highest level LSE believes that a reasonable assessor of risk or indeed any parent contemplating their child s involvement in such an exercise could only have concluded that the risks taken were unacceptable Our second major concern relates to information that came to light after the meeting on 9 April This is that John Sweeney gained entry to North Korea by posing as a PhD student The North Korean authorities allege that he described his occupation for entry control purposes as LSE student PhD in History and gave his address as that of LSE including a specific office room number which is actually used by a genuine member of LSE staff Students report that the North Korean guides during the visit repeatedly addressed him as Professor and that he actively went along with that John Sweeney graduated from LSE in 1980 with a BSc in Government He is not an LSE student If he has a PhD in History or anything else it is not from LSE He does not work for the LSE The letter stated that the chairman of LSE had asked the BBC to withdraw the programme and issue a full apology to the LSE for the actions of BBC staff in using the School and its good reputation as a means of deception This endangered the students and could endanger academics in the future LSE deeply regrets that earlier this afternoon the Director General of the BBC has refused the Chairman s request A student who went on the trip who wished to remain anonymous told the Beaver the university newspaper Tomiko Sweeney told us that there would be one journalist She implied that the journalist would not implicate us in any publication and that the journalist was not her Furthermore many among us believed that the journalist was only going to be writing a print article Alex Peters Day General Secretary of the LSE Students Union said students who had been on the trip had since received threatening letters from the North Korean government She added It was not the BBC s place to make decisions on behalf of the students on the trip nor was it the BBC s place to put at risk all those within the School What the BBC did was reckless and ethically reprehensible and I am just glad we are not facing a situation where our students are being detained in North Korea she said A BBC spokeswoman said We recognised that because it could increase the risks of the trip the students should be told in advance that a journalist intended to travel with them in order to enable the students to make their decision about whether they wanted to proceed They were given this information and were reminded of it again in time to have been able to change their plans if they wanted to The students were all explicitly warned about the potential risks of travelling to North Korea with the journalist as part of their group This included a warning about the risk of arrest and detention and that they might not be allowed to return to North Korea in the future On its Facebook page the Grimshaw Club committee issued their own statement They said We were surprised that LSE sent out an email about the North Korea trip before asking us to clarify our involvement in it We would like at this time to clarify the Grimshaw Club s role in this trip We had no organisational responsibilities with this trip and no Grimshaw resources or branding were used for this trip An LSE alum told us about the trip and we advertised as it an opportunity to our mailing list and our Facebook page that may be of interest to our members but we at no point had any organisational involvement with the trip In other words there was no institutional involvement on our part whatsoever and the trip participants were aware of that On its website it says it does not support any religious or political views of its own but attempts to have as broad a spectrum of issues available to its members to facilitate the debate of topics concerning international relations Previous trips have seen its members

the sense that I could hardly take my eyes off it The graphics the clothes the voices the sideburns In short the politics was the least fascinating thing about it This was a portal into another world

arrests under a local extension of the hate crime law recently widened to protect those who belong to recognisable alternative subcultures such as goths punks emos or metallers I m not fully up to speed on the nuances of 21st century teenage subculture but the definition of such groups generally involves flamboyant introspection piercings heavy black eyeliner noticeable hair dye and a general feeling of being at odds with mainstream society The word emo wasn t around when I was a teenager but I m pretty sure I ticked a few of those boxes myself bar the piercings There s the difficulty as one commentator the editor of a music magazine called Metal Hammer mused I have long hair and like metal music but have no facial piercings Am I metal enough to be protected Another a criminologist specialising in hate crime added Skaters are a group that should probably be protected Yes and how about heavily fake tanned Barbie lookalikes or deeply unpopular girls with bad skin and greasy hair who are too uncool even to belong to a recognisable teen category In the Manchester case a boy aged 14 and a 44 year old man were held after they allegedly assaulted a 16 year old boy who was described as an emo If the pair are guilty of the assault I hope that they are prosecuted and sentenced according to the maximum force of the law But the fact that it might have required an extension of the hate crime law to do that illustrates what illogical legislation it is in the first place The Manchester extension of the definition came about partly because of the campaigning of a brave woman called Sylvia Lancaster whose 20 year old daughter Sophie died from her injuries after she and her boyfriend Robert Maltby were beaten up in 2007 by a gang of five drunken teenage thugs Sophie and Robert were goths and the gang took exception to their appearance although the attackers seemingly needed very little excuse to plunge into a thoughtless orgy of brutality Ms Lancaster set up a foundation in her daughter s name which pledged among many other initiatives to work with police forces to ensure that people who are part of subcultures are protected by the law From her perspective that made sense when her daughter was killed goths did not come under the groups specially protected by hate crime legislation which carries heavier sentencing guidelines for perpetrators There was in effect a two tier justice system for victims First arrests for hate crime against Emo Mother of goth victim welcomes law change Hate crimes to include attacks on punks Goth or Emo It s time to help the Manchester police with their inquiries There still is Ms Lancaster has helped in Manchester at least to broaden the hate crime definition to include the category to which her beloved daughter belonged I can understand her instinct to do so but the difference is that I would extend the legislation potentially to include everyone which is I think where the concept would collapse The problem with creating a special category is that other victims who are equally vulnerable valued and beloved are frequently pushed outside it It also seems doomed to broaden patchily in perpetuity a report last week suggested extending the concept to cover attacks on sex workers At present on the Crown Prosecution Service CPS website the definition is almost impenetrable by human understanding It is any criminal offence committed against a person or property that is motivated by hostility towards someone based on their disability race religion gender identity or sexual orientation By gender identity as far as I can grasp the CPS means people who are transgender Which means I think were I beaten up and called a bitch by a stranger this would not count as a hate crime If my attacker heard my accent before the assault and broadened the invective to Irish bitch then it just might sneak in under the ethnicity or perceived ethnicity subcategory If an elderly woman is attacked simply for being vulnerable I don t think it technically counts but if the same thing happened to a man coming out of a known gay bar then it might Yet citizens inhabit innumerable criss crossing categories we are black white mixed race gay straight bisexual female male transgender goth preppy young old middle aged sober drunk fat thin mouthy and quiet The reasons why an aggressor might dislike one of us are innumerable and often random or unspoken Should the state s aim not be to regard all people as equal in the eyes of the law and punish those who do unprovoked harm accordingly It s an old fashioned notion I know but it seems the only sane way forward Let s get rid of the automatic hate crime categories and let judges determine additional sentencing in especially disgusting cases Because whatever motive criminals have when they rob harass hurt or murder any of their victims it certainly isn t love Lying about that age old problem A B movie actress called Junie Hoang is suing the Internet Movie Database IMDb website after it used her data to alter the false birthdate she had supplied it with to one that made her 41 Ms Hoang is indeed 41 but she is arguing that Hollywood is so prejudiced against older actresses that the move has seriously dented her career chances The case owes as much to issues of data privacy as to ageism but as a result of the publicity many more people worldwide now know that Ms Hoang is 41 when she could easily pass for 30 I suppose the IMDb revelation has been vexing like having a horribly indiscreet online friend who blurts out secrets at every click of a mouse but I m not sure that the rest of the world has any obligation to collude in a stage age People who persistently lie about their age are always nervous about being caught out it s a bit like going through life wearing an insecurely attached wig Still if you re going to fib do it boldly at any hint that an acquaintance is coyly withholding the information I have seen people pursue the issue like bloodhounds after a misplaced sausage I m a few months older than Ms Hoang and I wilfully trashed any chance of a stage age a while ago when I wrote about turning 40 I m glad I did because it would have made life a misery all that quickfire mental alteration of dates and the worried concealment of passports And it is of course a joy to torment one s other half every now and again with the loaded question Tell the truth what age do you think I could get away with and watch them struggle anew to formulate an answer in that delicate territory between flattery and credibility Why we fall out with our teeth Scientists have been poking around again in Otzi the Iceman the 5 300 year old man who is the world s oldest wet mummy and have discovered terrible dental cavities and advanced gum disease I feel sorry for Otzi who had a rough enough time without toothache on top it appears he was murdered but the news is oddly reassuring The maintenance of teeth in the 21st century has become inextricable from insidious guilt We are led to believe that our natural choppers should easily last a lifetime intact if only we didn t recklessly marinate them in fudge and fizzy drinks But there s Otzi who never even tasted a cupcake and look at the state of him Otzi s Neolithic problem was a carb rich diet of bread and porridge and the fact that he never brushed or flossed The reality is that teeth often aren t quite up to the job of being efficiently attached for a lifetime to an ordinary human We have always needed all the help we can get let us reach for the fluoride and smile

Alien as it was Das Boot Doctor Who has channelled Alien before in 2005 s Dalek but this episode actually felt more like Alien than half that franchise ever did And it proved a worthy return for one of the show s most iconic foes giving them a new twist by freeing the menace of their lumbering armour to wreak quickfire scaly skinned havoc around the submarine That clawed hand lowering from the ceiling was an inspired piece of direction Also on form were the impressive ensemble of guest stars Liam Cunningham proved a trusty ally as Commander Zhukov but the show stealer was David Warner as Professor Grisenko the big hearted Russian scientist with a thing for British electro pop It s treacherous ground to try and represent the Cold War with a romp but Gatiss handled things deftly with

For film makers musicians comedians and others in the creative community Mrs Thatcher was a person around whom there was a broad consensus the consensus was that she was a malign and destructive influence on Britain in general and the arts in particular In part this was personal Thatcher s professed cultural tastes were deeply conservative She may have loathed the BBC but she loved Yes Minister and the magic of Paul Daniels marvellous really so unbelievably skilled as she told Smash Hits magazine and the novels of Jeffrey Archer Her musical tastes included a fondness for Rolf Harris s Two Little Boys and How Much is that Doggie in the Window and the songs of Harry Secombe none of which was likely to endear her to the cultural elite However the caricature of the former prime minister as a philistine was arguably a distortion possibly one rooted in snobbishness and sexism Her selection for an edition of Desert Island Discs broadcast in 1978 when she was still leader of the Opposition largely featured works by classical composers Beethoven Verdi and Dvor k and in her conversation with presenter Roy Plomley she recalled playing the piano and singing in the Bach choir when at Oxford The antipathy towards Thatcher was about more than disdain for her own cultural habits it was inspired by a suspicion that her free market ideology had little time for the role of art to expand the imagination Richard Luce an arts minister during the second Thatcher administration was quoted as saying that many in the arts world had yet to be weaned away from the welfare state mentality and that the only test of our ability to succeed is whether we can attract customers During the Thatcher years funding to key arts organisations was dramatically cut prompting the novelist Hanif Kureishi to claim years later that the former prime minister was basically vulgar and has little cultural sophistication or understanding she actively hated culture as she recognised that it was a form of dissent Time stage took the Iron Lady seriously Margaret Thatcher on screen and stage Thatcher was kindly careful Margaret Thatcher 10 best books I was a dissenter I grew up during the Eighties and as a teenager my cultural diet was mostly the working class entertainments of television and music Shows like The Young Ones Spitting Image and Saturday Live in which Ben Elton would tear into Thatch were required viewing as was more mainstream fare like Only Fools and Horses and Minder Margaret Thatcher when I thought about her at all was the antithesis of everything I was and loved I was not yet aware of the irony that the dreaded Margaret was the creative catalyst for so much of what my generation was listening to and watching It is hard to imagine Mrs Thatcher laughing along to Elton or Alexei Sayle but without her it is doubtful there would have been the emergence of alternative comedy Thatcher was such a titanic political presence and her political opponents seemed so puny in comparison that it was almost as if the massed ranks of comedians and musicians and writers took it upon themselves to act as her unofficial opposition While she was in power the most notable artists to support her openly were Philip Larkin Gilbert George and Jim Davidson Meanwhile the roster of rock bands who recorded songs in which Thatcher or the Tories were the enemy is an impressive one a playlist call it Now That s Why I Hate Tories would include Margaret on the Guillotine by the Smiths Ghost Town by the Specials the Jam s A Town Called Malice Elvis Costello s Tramp the Dirt Down and Shipbuilding The The s Heartland and pretty much everything by Billy Bragg For better or worse Thatcher was a muse to a whole generation of comedians and songwriters an inspiring villain or an easy butt for jokes The Jam Town Called Malice on MUZU TV In politics and on the world stage Thatcher was a mesmerising figure Curiously she seemed least convincing in those rare moments when she interacted with popular culture I can still recall her excruciating appearance in 1987 on the BBC children s show Saturday Superstore when she was required to pass judgment on the new single from Pepsi Shirlie For one chilling moment she attempted to dance to the song the beat of which she summed up as thump thump thump but she looked like she would have been far more at ease closing down a coal mine She was hopeless at delivering jokes the only thing deader than the dead parrot she referred to in a 1990 conference speech in which she did her Monty Python impression at the expense of the Liberal Democrats was her delivery of the joke She was on surer ground when on her home territory of politics and there she was predominant Great drama demands strong characters compelling conflicts and a palpable sense of jeopardy and risk Thatcher and her government fulsomely satisfied all three conditions These were years of economic turbulence and social upheaval widespread unemployment the last days of mining the rise of the yuppie and mass home ownership and race riots It is perhaps not surprising that these were also years when writers such as John Sullivan Alan Bleasdale Ken Loach Dennis Potter and Jimmy McGovern were able to create some of the defining television drama of the Eighties Without Thatcher Yosser Hughes wouldn t have been saying gissa job on Boys from the Blackstuff there would have been no Arthur Daley and Del Boy wouldn t have been telling Rodney that this time next year they d be millionaires While much of Thatcher s impact on the arts was accidental some was the product of legislation she passed When she came to power there were only three television channels By the time she left office Sky television had been established there were a plethora of independent television production companies and a fourth channel that had become for the Eighties at least a home for edgy innovative films and programming The early Eighties also saw a radical new wave of experimental black film collectives which were often supported by Channel 4 formed in response to the increasing racial tension and social unrest in what was even then known as Thatcher s Britain The political rationale behind the decision to open up television was rooted in Thatcher s faith in free market competition the consequence was that writers such as Kureishi whose My Beautiful Laundrette was produced by Channel 4 and comedians like Jimmy Mulville who set up the influential Hat Trick production company were given access to new opportunities and audiences Haydn Gwynne as Margaret Thatcher in The Audience Margaret Thatcher left office in 1990 and yet through her legislation and her legacy her influence remains Two of the most successful British films made since she departed Downing Street The Full Monty 1997 and Billy Elliot 2000 are both set in communities blighted by her economic policies And although she spent the last decade of her life largely out of the public eye her fictional avatars have been everywhere in film portrayed by Meryl Streep in The Iron Lady on television played by Andrea Riseborough in The Long Walk to Finchley and currently on stage in Peter Morgan s The Audience where she is being played by Haydn Gwynne It is a sign both of how potently iconic she remains and the extent to which the consequences of her time in power

Granta list of the 20 brightest and most promising young British writers is about to be revealed What impact has it had on the literary landscape over the last 30 years The Granta Best of Young British Novelists list swoops into view every 10 years like a literary comet If previous years are anything to go by the latest list announced on Monday will be accompanied by a long tail of debate controversy and boosted book sales Granta s first list of 20 writers aged under 40 was published in 1983 and set the bar for the decades to come Many of the class of 83 have become household names such as Martin Amis William Boyd Kazuo Ishiguro Salman Rushdie Julian Barnes Pat Barker Ian McEwan and Rose Tremain The 1993 list included Iain Banks Louis de Bernieres Alan Hollinghurst Hanif Kureishi Ben Okri Will Self and Jeanette Winterson One commentator is said to have sniped in 1993 But who is Louis de Bernieres The answer came a year later when Captain Corelli s Mandolin turned into an international bestseller The last Granta list in 2003 included Monica Ali whose Brick Lane was still in manuscript form when she was elevated into the literary firmament Rachel Cusk AL Kennedy David Mitchell Zadie Smith and Sarah Waters It s rare that you have a water cooler moment regarding a book The 1983 list was exceptional says Jonathan Ruppin web editor at Foyles There were some outstanding writers in there who have become major figures in the world of literature and when you look at the 1993 and 2003 list the hit rate is still pretty high He predicts that the 2013 list will prove as much as a talking point as in previous decades Obviously it will provoke a lot of debate and a lot of people will dismiss it but anything that gets people talking about books in general can only be beneficial Books aren t a central part of our culture any more literature is a bit second tier There s plenty of coverage of films music TV and video games It s rare that you have a water cooler moment regarding a book So how did it all begin The 1983 campaign was dreamed up in the bath by Desmond Clarke who was at the time the director of the Book Marketing Council He describes the BMC as a characteristically Eighties organisation which undertook promotions and research on behalf of the book trade The list of 20 young novelists inspired a special issue of literary magazine Granta under the editorship of Bill Buford Introducing the second list in 1993 Buford wrote the campaign s greatest value was this it became despite itself a serious statement about British literary culture One of the most striking images from the first campaign was a group photograph of the young novelists by Lord Snowdon published in the Sunday Times Magazine But not everyone was happy Clarke recalls how the list managed to ruffle a few feathers in literary circles Every time the literati got a bit sniffy that worked in our favour There were some who looked down their noses at the way we were marketing literary fiction and making it fun The whole idea of the list was to create controversy and get people arguing Every time the literati got a bit sniffy that worked in our favour With the backing of bookshops and libraries the first Best of Young British promotion helped sell an additional 250 000 books Before the campaign some of the books had only sold a few hundred notes Clarke Many of them were not published in paperback As literary agent Andrew Kidd points out the Granta list has a different function to an annual literary award such as his newly founded Folio Prize or the long established Man Booker Most literary prizes are for single works it s a snapshot of a writer at a certain point in his or her career pegged to a particular book The Granta list is more about recognising who in the eyes of the Granta judges are the most exciting emerging talents it s as much about a prediction of future work as it is about the body of work to date It generates a different kind of buzz From a readers perspective it s about signalling the writers you want to be following over the decades to come But what effect does being on a list like this have on a relatively unknown writer Any level of success puts pressure on an author and makes the expectations of their publisher higher says Ruppin But it does give them a profile that is extraordinarily valuable in what is a ridiculously crowded market That was certainly true in the case of Alison Moore s debut novel The Lighthouse from independent publisher Salt which made the Man Booker shortlist in 2012 Jen Hamilton Emery Salt s co director recalls how the book s inclusion caused a huge spike in sales and media interest It s dream come to true to be on a list like that Nothing can prepare you We d never had to contend with print runs in the tens of thousands All the logistics came into play and we were able to cope The Norfolk based publisher formed in 1999 has built up a Twitter following of more than 85 000 in recent years When you re small your have to find creative ways of marketing that don t cost money explains Hamilton Emery We ve not had publicists to rely on We ve enjoyed bringing people on our journey with us through social media Literary lists she says have a role to play beyond book sales They are wonderful tools for marketing but they are more than that The Granta and Booker have got proper weight behind them and proper credibility As a publisher we would obviously like people to read wider than the list but it can be a catalyst to more creative reading Desmond Clarke meanwhile is looking forward to seeing how his 1983 concept will play out in 2013 Of course it s flattering when one s idea is repeated and copied several times over I m not particularly knowledgeable about new authors so I m going to be given a list of 20 exciting new novelists and hopefully amongst them will be the new Ian McEwan Salman Rushdie William Boyd or Kazuo Ishiguro John Freeman Granta s editor since 2009 tells The Guardian the biggest challenge for the judges has been how to come up with an amalgamated definition of hope for the novel as a form My own preference is for novelists who can tell big stories which sounds easy but in my experience is as rare as the long whiskered owlet We are all hoping we ve got it just as right as the three lists before us BBC Radio 4 s Front Row will

smattering of an audience turned out to hear this excellent duo recital by violinist Pekka Kuusisto and pianist and composer Olli Mustonen despite them being two of Finland s most original and intrepid classical musicians despite this being one of only two tour dates in the UK and despite the programme containing an impressive new work by Mustonen himself Tumbleweed on a Friday night in Perth can t do much for any performers morale the inadvertent flipside was that with the pressure off and the gathering intimate the pair treated us to an evening of extraordinarily relaxed inventive and daring music making They opened with Beethoven s Violin Sonata in A Op 30 No 1 and at first seemed oddly matched Both are bold performers and both articulated with extreme pinpoint precision but Mustonen s jaunty jerky attack jarred heavily with Kuusisto s silvery sound in the opening bars Soon though the partnership began to make sense for its complementary differences rather than any reiterative similarities The piano s breadth and sturdy percussiveness formed a strong base for the violin s long lines and stripped back tone and together they made Beethoven s writing sound spontaneous and fresh It was in Ravel s Violin Sonata and Stravinsky s Duo Concertante that the duo really came into their own Ravel s dreamy opening sounded otherworldly and exploratory and the Blues movement was brilliantly deadpan Stravinsky s motoric rhythms were spiky and spry and the Concertante s slow movements Epilogue II and Dithyrambe were touchingly mournful Mustonen s new Sonata for violin and piano is a striking bravely uncluttered piece of writing It opens with a searching angular solo violin theme that insistently repeats to the backdrop of a cascading piano chorale A propulsive middle movement gives way to a haunting finale It certainly deserves a second listen What have you been to see lately Tell us about it on Twitter using GdnReview", "One of the pleasures of being a jobbing film director is spending time with talents such as Alan Sharp I trailed happily around New Zealand and Los Angeles after him for a year or so while we tried to beat Robert Louis

the science we take for granted today He even found time to design the Dark Side of the Moon album cover There was a dark side to Newton too according to this documentary with drama Isaac Newton The Last Magician BBC2 He was a loner an obsessive and a neurotic And as revealed in writings that were buried after his death to protect his reputation but which came to light in the 1930s he was not just obsessed with pure science and mathematics but also with heretical religion alchemy and the occult Heavens What next Einstein was a secret psychic Stephen Hawking s into voodoo Actually the programme argues Newton s interest in alchemy far from hindering his scientific and mathematical discoveries actually helped Perhaps Richard Dawkins should dabble in a bit of heretical religion no maybe not Some of the scenes with actors are a bit weird They re speaking words from Newton s journals and from the writings of his contemporaries and it doesn t come across as very natural Maybe it doesn t really matter it s still fascinating You wouldn t guess that The Security Man ITV was written by Caroline Aherne along with Jeff Pope It has neither the acerbic wit of Mrs Merton nor the look in the mirror recognition and realism of The Royle Family Instead it s a jolly caper Three security men are caught literally off guard when they abandon their posts to watch the Amir Khan fight and the jewellers in the mall they re supposed to be guarding is robbed With the help of a techie nephew and some very amateur dramatics they mock up CCTV footage of them being a bit more heroic It s

Education Editor 11 24AM BST 14 Apr 2013 Comments Professors working in politically sensitive countries overseas may be in danger after a television crew used an LSE student trip as a front to film inside the totalitarian state it was claimed The Panorama programme also threatens to jeopardise future overseas visits by the university and has led to students being sent threatening letters by Kim Jong un s government The comments threatened to escalate the row between the LSE and the BBC over a controversial programme due to be shown on Monday that seeks to expose conditions within the most rigidly controlled nation on Earth The university has already called on the corporation to pull the programme because of claims that students were fed lies and deception over the trip A three strong BBC team led by reporter John Sweeney travelled to the secretive state last month posing as members of the LSE s Grimshaw Club a student society that forms part of the International Relations Department BBC accused of putting students at risk after journalists infiltrate university trip to North Korea Graphic how far can North Korea s missiles reach North Korea s state of war declaration full text North Korea timeline of escalating threats North Korea enters state of war against South South Korea declare full military readiness The BBC has become embroiled in a row with the LSE after an undercover team used a student visit to North Korea to film a documentary about the state Photo GETTY While in North Korea the Panorama team filmed undercover footage that will be broadcast in North Korea Undercover The BBC said reporters witnessed a landscape bleak beyond words a people brainwashed for three generations and a regime happy to give the impression of marching towards Armageddon Commenting on the row Mr Sweeney said that students had twice been told of the presence of the BBC crew and willingly proceeded with the visit although full details of the undercover investigation were withheld for their own safety The LSE hierarchy was also not informed about the trip in advance It had been suggested that the trip was a student organised affair that was joined by the BBC crew But the general secretary of the LSE Students Union said the trip was orchestrated by the corporation and both students and the university had been manipulated and used as human shields Alex Peters Day said it was organised by Mr Sweeney s wife also a Panorama producer who advertised it through the society mailing list I think the trip was organised by the BBC as a rouse to get into North Korea and that s disgraceful she said They have used students essentially as a human shield in this situation Ten LSE students went on the trip and were initially told just one BBC reporter would be accompanying them They were only told that a three strong team would be present during a stopover in Beijing Three students and one parent have subsequently lodged complaints over the BBC s actions Miss Peters Day said some of the students had subsequently been sent threatening messages from North Korea It was only once they got home and the North Korean government emailed them that the full implications of what had happened started to slip into place she said It was absolutely a threatening letter Prof George Gaskill the university s deputy director said the trip posed dangers to LSE academics Some of my colleagues at present are in Africa China and various other sensitive countries he said If their independence and integrity is challenged they may find themselves at considerable risk His comments were backed by Universities UK the higher education umbrella group Nicola Dandridge chief executive said The way that this BBC investigation was conducted might not only have put students safety at risk but may also have damaged our universities reputations overseas An email sent to LSE students and staff said university authorities did not have advance knowledge of the visit The email said At no point prior to the trip was it made clear to the students that a BBC team of three had planned to use the trip as cover for a major documentary to be shown on Panorama It is LSE s view that the students were not given enough information to enable informed consent yet were given enough to put them in serious danger if the subterfuge had been uncovered prior to their departure from North Korea In a statement a Panorama spokeswoman said We recognised that because it could increase the risks of the trip the students should be told in advance that a journalist intended to travel with them in order to enable the students to make their decision about whether they wanted to proceed They were given this information and were reminded of it again in time to have been able to change their plans if they wanted to The students were all explicitly warned about the potential risks of travelling to North Korea with the journalist as part of their group This included a warning about the risk of arrest and detention and that they might not be allowed to return to North Korea in the future", "BBC Asian Network has been nominated for a leading radio award

Francisco Fern ndez spans four decades of Margaret Drabble s writing career from 1966 to 2000 As they are arranged chronologically it s possible to see the same themes resurfacing and evolving across the years Much of Drabble s short fiction unpicks what is to be a successful and accomplished woman usually an academic or media personality a woman of outward composure grappling with the demands of lovers family co workers and her own wayward flesh The earliest story Hassan s Tower features a honeymooning couple who are spending their first few days of wedded life in Morocco But while their unvoiced worries about money and class there s a deliciously awkward scene in which neither one of them will ask the price of some canap s undercut the enforced romance of the experience at first by the end the characters find their eyes opened to the interconnectedness of people In the title story published in 1973 a woman who prides herself on her efficiency is confronted with the fact that a little bit of the mechanism in me has broken Her own body is part of this conspiracy and as if she can longer hold it all in anymore she seeps and leaks the final image of her calmly addressing a room full of people while unseen blood spills from her remains an incredibly potent one While the earlier stories are tauter and more depersonalised full of glinting detail the later ones have a more sweeping open quality The protagonists age accordingly as the years pass while the use of landscape features more prominently in her writing There s a delicate sense of quest to the final story the Wordsworth inspired Stepping Westward written in 1994 though not published until 2000 in which a teacher treks though the Quantocks in search of something more than just the poetic While the body remains a mutinous thing with a tendency to break there s more of a sense of acceptance of oneself a feeling of potential energy yet to be spent and wonder at a world that can still surprise Write

ago at the height of 1990s Britpop But the speculation around Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead the Wizard of Oz song which became the focus of an anti Thatcher campaign on Facebook was not just about where it would chart but how much of it the BBC would play The tune from the 1939 Judy Garland film narrowly missed out on the No 1 spot in Sunday s chart finishing second to Need U the crossover house hit by Duke Dumont featuring A M E despite a last minute surge in sales After the BBC s new director general Tony Hall intervened the BBC played just a seven second clip of the song part of a news item by Radio 1 music reporter Sinead Garvan that lasted just over 90 seconds Thatcher she told listeners strongly divided opinion between those who accused her of putting millions out of work and not caring about the poor and those who believe she changed the UK for the better by taking Britain s then failing economy and making it successful She added Some politicians said it was disrespectful to play it while others say it is because she stood for freedom and allowing people to have their say There was no appearance on the news item by either Hall or Radio 1 controller Ben Cooper The song at just 51 seconds long was already the shortest ever to make the top 10 according to the Official Charts Company However in a decision which is sure to anger critics of the decision to censor the track the BBC played another song which was at the centre of a pro Thatcher campaign in full and without explanation by the presenter Jameela Jamil The 34 year old song I m in Love with Margaret Thatcher by punk band the Notsensibles charted at No 35 Former Tory MP Louise Mensch was among those who urged people to download the song which featured in Meryl Streep s 2011 Thatcher biopic The Iron Lady in protest at the Ding Dong campaign Paul Robinson a former managing editor of Radio 1 and ex head of strategy at BBC Radio was critical of the decision only to play a short clip of the Wizard of Oz track It sets a very dangerous precedent because they have taken an editorial view on a song in the Top 40 They have destroyed the idea that it is the people s chart and not the property of the BBC he said History is full of songs that were never part of Radio 1 s playlist but made it on to the chart The only issue the BBC should consider is whether the language is appropriate for the time of day the Top 40 is broadcast Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead joins a list of songs censored by the BBC including Relax by Frankie Goes to Hollywood in 1984 and God Save the Queen by the Sex Pistols which was banned in 1977 That the Sex Pistols song never made it to No 1 in the year of the Queen s silver jubilee it was held off the top spot by Rod Stewart s I Don t Want to Talk About It has always been seized on by conspiracy theorists Ding Dong sold 52 605 copies more than 18 000 of them since last Friday after controversy began to mount 5 700 behind Need U which had a weekly sale of 58 321 I m in Love with Margaret Thatcher was downloaded 8 768 times In the first test of Hall s leadership the director general said he found the anti Thatcher campaign distasteful and inappropriate But he said it would be wrong to ban the song outright as free speech is an important principle and a ban would only give it more publicity But the compromise he reached with the Radio 1 controller Cooper is in all likelihood doomed to satisfy neither Thatcher s sternest critics or her most ardent supporters", "The BBC has insisted it will broadcast a controversial Panorama documentary about North Korea despite protests from the London School of Economics LSE that journalist John Sweeney put its staff working abroad at risk by posing as a student from the institution to gain access to the communist state Tony Hall the newly arrived BBC director general has rejected a request from LSE chairman Peter Sutherland to shelve the Panorama documentary Hall who has already had to defuse a row over anti Thatcher song Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead less than two weeks after taking over at the BBC responded to a letter from Sutherland last week He is understood to have said that the Panorama documentary on North Korea would go ahead as there was a clear public interest in reporting on the escalating situation in the country The director general is also understood to have said that the BBC had considered the risks involved and made sure the students on the trip were able to make an informed decision about the potential danger Ceri Thomas BBC News head of programmes echoed this line on Sunday saying the Panorama documentary North Korea Undercover due to be broadcast on Monday evening was an important piece of public interest journalism and that the LSE students on the academic trip Sweeney used to gain access to North Korea had given their informed consent for him to accompany them The material fact is that the LSE students on the trip were made fully aware of what the risks were if this journalist were to be discovered The only people we deceived were the North Korean government Thomas a former editor of Radio 4 s Today programme told the same station s The World This Weekend on Sunday lunchtime This is an important piece of public interest journalism This is a country hidden from view and central to current events However George Gaskell pro director of the LSE and professor of social psychology clashed with Thomas on The World This Weekend disputing whether students on the trip had known the true nature of Sweeney s activities and accusing the BBC of deliberately misleading them The LSE had earlier said students on the trip may have been told Sweeney was a journalist but not that he and two other BBC journalists travelling with them would be using the visit to film an undercover documentary Gaskell said on Sunday the LSE had received complaints from three of the 10 students on the trip which was organised by a student society of the university the Grimshaw Club the student society of the International Relations Department which dates back to the 1920s The BBC has admitted that the group was deliberately misled about the involvement of the BBC The line that was used was that a BBC journalist would join the visit he added We were told the BBC had undertaken a risk assessment and it had been at the highest level I would ve thought the risk is unacceptable We clearly have a different view on what is acceptable risk I think it s potentially extremely dangerous Gaskell said that even if the students had given their consent to Sweeney joining them prior to arriving in North Korea they might feel very differently if they had found themselves in solitary confinement in the country He added that the BBC s actions posed less danger to the students who went on the North Korea trip than to his LSE academic colleagues working in other parts of the world Some are in Africa some in China They may find themselves at considerable risk Sweeney accused the LSE of putting out statements that were factually inaccurate He said he had spoken to the students who were on the North Korea trip since their return and the majority did not believe they were misled Thomas told The World This Weekend that the public interest in the story justified the subterfuge used to gain access to North Korea where foreign journalists cannot get visas but overseas academics and students can He said he was satisfied that the students on the trip had been given enough information to give their informed consent Thomas added that the students were told twice that a BBC journalist would be accompanying them to North Korea and if this was discovered they could face detention before they set off from London and again before entering the country when they reached Beijing where they were told of Sweeney s identity Thomas added that those on the North Korea trip were not teenagers just out of the school and that the youngest had consulted their parents before leaving the UK A number of those on the trip had requested that their identity be protected and the BBC had agreed to pixelate or use other techniques to obscure their features in the Panorama documentary he said Sweeney spent eight days in North Korea in March with the LSE group The LSE said it first became aware of the true nature of his visit last Tuesday 9 April during a meeting with BBC staff The university said North Korean authorities alleged that Sweeney described himself on his visa application as an LSE student PhD in history and gave as his address a room number that is used by a member of its academic staff Students on the trip reported that their North Korean guides repeatedly referred to Sweeney as professor and he went along with this according to the LSE Sweeney graduated from the LSE in 1980 with a BSc in government and if he has a PhD it is not from there the university added", "Abby Lee Miller is a visionary a maverick a self styled dance

database revealed her age IMDb argued it had the right to publish accurate data and that Hoang 41 could not prove she lost out because of it According to the website her credits include the 2011 title Gingerdead Man 3 Saturday Night Cleaver The site which was launched in the early 1990s and purchased by Amazon in 1998 continues to post Ms Hoang s date of birth on her profile page In court documents filed anonymously in 2011 Amazon and its movie database subsidiary were accused of breach of contract fraud violation of privacy and consumer protection laws Parent company Amazon was dismissed as a defendant before the two day trial which concluded on Thursday The database s stance drew criticism in 2011 from two acting unions who accused the site of facilitating age discrimination During the trial though the site s attorneys said IMDb was not responsible for the actions taken by people who read their profiles Ms Hoang who had been seeking 1m 650 000 in damages had initially provided the site with a false birth year that reduced her stated age by seven years When she asked for that information to be removed the site used a public records search to discover her true date of birth and

the one she inherited on entering Downing Street and not just because of the internet Twitter and Facebook When Margaret Thatcher became Britain s first woman prime minister in May 1979 The Times didn t report the fact It had stopped publication because of an industrial dispute which closed it for 11 months So had its sister paper the Sunday Times Within three months ITV was also on strike blacking out all television advertising in the UK for 11 weeks Those lengthy shutdowns are a reminder of just how different life was in 1979 and how the media business was transformed by her time in office In 1979 as in many areas of industry leaders of the printing broadcasting and telecoms unions ruled the roost as Rupert Murdoch recalled in a personal tribute to Margaret Thatcher in The Times this week We were stuck with an industry that refused to change its ways he wrote There were constant threats to go slow to stop the presses or to walk out altogether It couldn t go on The restrictive practices inflated the pay of union members both in newspapers and broadcasting reduced company profits and protected over manning in the face of new technology already commonplace in other countries In 1982 there were only three television channels and the country was in the grip of a deep recession with Margaret Thatcher in power Then along came Channel 4 British newspapers were printed only in black and white colour was confined to the supplements and the number of pages and sections was severely limited But it wasn t only the unions that imposed restrictions Copyright on TV listings meant newspapers couldn t print the next day s programme schedules let alone the next week s Viewers had to buy both Radio Times for BBC programmes and TV Times for ITV to find out what would be on protecting the broadcasters lucrative publishing duopoly And under Government control of the airwaves ITV was the only television channel allowed to show commercials which it sold through 15 regional monopolies Only in London could advertisers negotiate with rival companies Thames and London Weekend Television But the seeds of the transformation had already been sown Margaret Thatcher was elected with a public mandate to tame the unions following Labour s Winter of Discontent in 1978 9 which left bodies unburied and mountains of uncollected rubbish She introduced industrial relations legislation which outlawed closed shops secondary picketing and made secret ballots compulsory instead of mass show of hands voting Taking advantage of the new laws Murdoch decided to break the unions power secretly moving his four national newspapers to a new plant in Wapping east London which used the new computerised technology Mrs Thatcher had strengthened Murdoch s hand by letting him take over The Times and the Sunday Times even though he already owned the Sun and the News of the World The previous owners the Thomson Organisation had decided to sell after the 11 month closure The last straw was when their journalists who had received full pay throughout the dispute voted to go on strike themselves The Times had made losses for many years but the Sunday Times with a large circulation and packed with advertising was assumed to be very profitable To many people s surprise the Thatcher government permitted the takeover without referring it to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission The former editor of the Sunday Times Sir Harold Evans wrote A newspaper merger unprecedented in history went through in three days The decision was formally taken by the Secretary of State for Trade John Biffen on the grounds that the two papers were not going concerns and could close if the takeover were delayed by an MMC investigation The ruling was hotly criticised in parliament and the press In his book Good Times Bad Times Sir Harold reported that Mrs Thatcher was the architect of the deal Normally the apostle of competition on this occasion the lady was ready for turning the U turn she executed was in the expectation that Murdoch s affinity with her politics would impel him to ensure favourable coverage For many years it was denied not least in the official history of The Times that the two had met in the run up to the bid being cleared But in 2012 it emerged from papers released under the 30 year rule that Murdoch had had a secret lunch with Mrs Thatcher at Chequers to put his plans to her Evans wrote that the meeting that never took place was highly improper Mrs Thatcher s press spokesman Bernard Ingham in a note of the meeting claimed that she did nothing more than wish him well in his bid and noted the need to improve Fleet Street staffing levels and to introduce new technology With four national newspapers two daily two Sunday quality as well as popular Murdoch was now in a stronger position to take on the unions at Wapping In January 1986 he made his move The resulting dispute which led to violent battles between police and pickets lasted months reinforcing the media mogul s reputation as a hate figure among the left Eventually Murdoch won not merely increasing his papers profitability but helping his rivals to introduce the new technology as well as new entrants to the market such as the Independent Andrew Neil then the editor of the Sunday Times said on Radio 4 s The Media Show this week that Thatcher played a crucial role in the publisher s victory and not just by outlawing secondary picketing He said Rupert Murdoch had told him that he had squared Mrs Thatcher as far as the police were concerned that he d had a guarantee from her that enough police would be made available to keep the company going about its lawful business He went on I remember it well because he compared it with New York he had not attempted this with the New York Post because he didn t think the mayor could deliver on that and he didn t think he could count on the police if he tried to do the same there The Thatcher government was also trying to shake up broadcasting After numerous rows with the BBC over issues such as the coverage of the Falklands Conflict in 1982 the Real Lives documentary on Northern Ireland terrorism and the bombing of Libya in 1986 Mrs Thatcher hoped to cut the corporation down to size She set up the Peacock Committee to examine whether the BBC could be funded by advertising so the licence fee could be scrapped Ideologically she was very opposed to the BBC perceiving it to be very left wing said Professor Patrick Barwise of the London Business School who was advising the corporation at the time On The Media Show he said It took us a very short time to persuade the committee it wasn t a runner If you d had advertising on the BBC the revenue would have come from ITV and you d have had less money for programmes Meanwhile a new BBC director general John Birt was making radical changes at the corporation which were highly unpopular with its staff His supporters say that stopped the Thatcher government breaking up the BBC and selling off stations like Radio 1 Instead she turned her attention to ITV In 1987 at a Downing Street summit Mrs Thatcher told ITV bosses that their industry was the last bastion of restrictive practices In her memoirs The Downing Street Years she wrote Broadcasting was one of a number of areas in which special pleading by powerful interest groups was disguised as high minded commitment to some greater good Attempts to break the powerful duopoly which the BBC and ITV had achieved which encouraged restrictive practices increased costs and kept out talent were decried as threatening the quality of broadcasting The first shake up came with the launch of Channel 4 in November 1982 An earlier government report had concluded that the younger generation of producers is bubbling over with ideas which are not allowed to surface and the Thatcher government decreed that most of its programmes should be provided by a new breed of independent producers Phil Redmond creator of Brookside was one of them On its 30th anniversary he wrote In 1982 there were only three television channels and the country was in the grip of a deep recession with Margaret Thatcher in power Then along came Channel 4 It made a huge immediate impact as it was given the remit to cater for minorities and find voices that were unheard and it certainly lived up to that It allowed new people to be seen on TV with new ideas and voices But the biggest shake up in commercial television came from the decision to award ITV licences to the highest bidder subject to a quality hurdle It was highly controversial One of ITV s most successful programme making companies Thames Television was outbid by Carlton Television led by Michael Green He had earlier tried to buy Thames but been prevented from doing so by the regulator the Independent Broadcasting Authority as he described on The Media Show The licence process had an unexpected and unwelcome outcome for Mrs Thatcher The man often described as her favourite TV executive Bruce Gyngell had turned the ailing breakfast station TV am into profit and kept it on the air during a union dispute in 1987 helping transform working practices in the industry But TV am was beaten by an unrealistically high bid from GMTV Mr Gyngell later received a letter from the prime minister which caused a sensation when he read it out at an awards lunch When I see how some of the other licences have been awarded she wrote I am mystified that you did not receive yours and heartbroken I am only too painfully aware that I was

14 Apr 2013 Comments Professors working in politically sensitive countries overseas may be in danger after a television crew used an LSE student trip as a front to film inside the totalitarian state it was claimed The Panorama programme also threatens to jeopardise future overseas visits by the university and has led to students being sent threatening letters by Kim Jong un s government The comments threatened to escalate the row between the LSE and the BBC over a controversial programme due to be shown on Monday that seeks to expose conditions within the most rigidly controlled nation on Earth The university has already called on the corporation to pull the programme because of claims that students were fed lies and deception over the trip A three strong BBC team led by reporter John Sweeney travelled to the secretive state last month posing as members of the LSE s Grimshaw Club a student society that forms part of the International Relations Department BBC accused of putting students at risk after journalists infiltrate university trip to North Korea Graphic how far can North Korea s missiles reach North Korea s state of war declaration full text North Korea timeline of escalating threats North Korea enters state of war against South South Korea declare full military readiness The BBC has become embroiled in a row with the LSE after an undercover team used a student visit to North Korea to film a documentary about the state Photo GETTY While in North Korea the Panorama team filmed undercover footage that will be broadcast in North Korea Undercover The BBC said reporters witnessed a landscape bleak beyond words a people brainwashed for three generations and a regime happy to give the impression of marching towards Armageddon Commenting on the row Mr Sweeney said that students had twice been told of the presence of the BBC crew and willingly proceeded with the visit although full details of the undercover investigation were withheld for their own safety The LSE hierarchy was also not informed about the trip in advance It had been suggested that the trip was a student organised affair that was joined by the BBC crew But the general secretary of the LSE Students Union said the trip was orchestrated by the corporation and both students and the university had been manipulated and used as human shields Alex Peters Day said it was organised by Mr Sweeney s wife also a Panorama producer who advertised it through the society mailing list I think the trip was organised by the BBC as a rouse to get into North Korea and that s disgraceful she said They have used students essentially as a human shield in this situation Ten LSE students went on the trip and were initially told just one BBC reporter would be accompanying them They were only told that a three strong team would be present during a stopover in Beijing Three students and one parent have subsequently lodged complaints over the BBC s actions Miss Peters Day said some of the students had subsequently been sent threatening messages from North Korea It was only once they got home and the North Korean government emailed them that the full implications of what had happened started to slip into place she said It was absolutely a threatening letter Prof George Gaskill the university s deputy director said the trip posed dangers to LSE academics Some of my colleagues at present are in Africa China and various other sensitive countries he said If their independence and integrity is challenged they may find themselves at considerable risk His comments were backed by Universities UK the higher education umbrella group Nicola Dandridge chief executive said The way that this BBC investigation was conducted might not only have put students safety at risk but may also have damaged our universities reputations overseas An email sent to LSE students and staff said university authorities did not have advance knowledge of the visit The email said At no point prior to the trip was it made clear to the students that a BBC team of three had planned to use the trip as cover for a major documentary to be shown on Panorama It is LSE s view that the students were not given enough information to enable informed consent yet were given enough to put them in serious danger if the subterfuge had been uncovered prior to their departure from North Korea In a statement a Panorama spokeswoman said We recognised that because it could increase the risks of the trip the students should be told in advance that a journalist intended to travel with them in order to enable the students to make their decision about whether they wanted to proceed They were given this information and were reminded of it again in time to have been able to change their plans if they wanted to The students were all explicitly warned about the potential risks of travelling to North Korea with the journalist as part of their group This included a warning about the risk of arrest and detention and that they might not be allowed to return to North Korea in the future", "The UK premiere of Iron Man 3 has been pushed back due to Baroness Thatcher s funeral according to reports A

commander surrendered to British forces in the Falklands With their heads bowed the 4 000 Argentinian conscripts marched silently to the nearby Lahusen barracks where they were discharged from duty and told to return to their homes Argentina s 11 000 Falklands veterans were not greeted as heroes but shunned by the dictatorship as reminders of an embarrassing defeat And when Argentina returned to democracy a year later they were widely seen as tainted by their association with the reviled military junta Former soldiers who went to war as teenagers were left to rebuild their shattered lives by themselves There were 649 Argentinian servicemen killed in the war and a further 350 veterans have reportedly killed themselves since but their story has been widely ignored as the war faded in a kind of collective amnesia Now a group of young film makers is seeking to change that with Argentina s first TV drama about the Falklands conflict Combatientes or Fighters draws on interviews with veterans to tell the fictional story of five conscripts and an officer before during and after the war as the protagonist Gustavo Ribero tries to remember what happened to him on the final night on the islands Written and directed by Tom s de las Heras 29 and Jeronimo Paz Clemente 31 it was aired on the state TV channel Canal 7 As members of a generation that did not live through the dictatorship De las Heras and his team felt the time had come to reconsider the war s legacy and offer alternatives to the politically charged dispute over the islands The idea of the series was to explore the soldiers heroism in the face of hunger loss and exclusion rather than to glorify the war and the motives behind it The problem we faced was how to talk about heroism in the context of the defeat without being pro war De las Heras said So we started thinking about how to express that heroism and we felt that the companionship and help they offered to one another in times of hunger and cold had to be the focus We wanted to talk about their personal struggle and how they helped each other to survive By using an army official as a lead character De las Heras hoped it would mark the start of a dialogue in society We have the opportunity to mend the animosity between the people and the army This is a country with a long history of military coups To have a protagonist who is a lieutenant and then try and humanise him was a risk But I think there is less danger in speaking about these things than being silent In its first week Fighters was Canal 7 s second most watched programme and praised for its unprecedented quality Viewers took to Facebook and Twitter to commend the producers for creating an Argentinian Band of Brothers On a military forum Falklands veterans praised the drama s accuracy and attention to detail One reason it has taken so long to produce a Falklands themed drama is because Argentina s TV output is dominated by cheap but popular telenovelas or soap operas Fighters won a competition and secured the 1 6m pesos 200 000 budget provided by the government through the National Institute for Audio visual Arts and Cinema and the University of San Mart n The military then donated the props and let the team film for nothing at Campo de Mayo the army s largest military base The writer admitted the diplomatic tension between Argentina and Britain as well as the publicity surrounding the 30th anniversary of the Falklands war may have helped with funding Although a first for television the Falklands war has featured in a handful of Argentinian films and several novels and documentaries But the team behind Fighters said that most past portrayals had been too politicised Some productions are so close to the political and the organic fabric of the war that the narrative is consumed by the need to describe the historical process I don t want to say they were propagandistic because it sounds aggressive but the narrative was lost De las Heras said We didn t want to vindicate the veterans politically or socially That pain is deeply personal and can only be understood by those who went there We need to look at it in a personal human way because politics

obituaries tell us a divisive prime minister but this is not quite the full story For film makers musicians comedians and others in the creative community Mrs Thatcher was a person around whom there was a broad consensus the consensus was that she was a malign and destructive influence on Britain in general and the arts in particular In part this was personal Thatcher s professed cultural tastes were deeply conservative She may have loathed the BBC but she loved Yes Minister and the magic of Paul Daniels marvellous really so unbelievably skilled as she told Smash Hits magazine and the novels of Jeffrey Archer Her musical tastes included a fondness for Rolf Harris s Two Little Boys and How Much is that Doggie in the Window and the songs of Harry Secombe none of which was likely to endear her to the cultural elite However the caricature of the former prime minister as a philistine was arguably a distortion possibly one rooted in snobbishness and sexism Her selection for an edition of Desert Island Discs broadcast in 1978 when she was still leader of the Opposition largely featured works by classical composers Beethoven Verdi and Dvor k and in her conversation with presenter Roy Plomley she recalled playing the piano and singing in the Bach choir when at Oxford The antipathy towards Thatcher was about more than disdain for her own cultural habits it was inspired by a suspicion that her free market ideology had little time for the role of art to expand the imagination Richard Luce an arts minister during the second Thatcher administration was quoted as saying that many in the arts world had yet to be weaned away from the welfare state mentality and that the only test of our ability to succeed is whether we can attract customers During the Thatcher years funding to key arts organisations was dramatically cut prompting the novelist Hanif Kureishi to claim years later that the former prime minister was basically vulgar and has little cultural sophistication or understanding she actively hated culture as she recognised that it was a form of dissent Time stage took the Iron Lady seriously Margaret Thatcher on screen and stage Thatcher was kindly careful Margaret Thatcher 10 best books I was a dissenter I grew up during the Eighties and as a teenager my cultural diet was mostly the working class entertainments of television and music Shows like The Young Ones Spitting Image and Saturday Live in which Ben Elton would tear into Thatch were required viewing as was more mainstream fare like Only Fools and Horses and Minder Margaret Thatcher when I thought about her at all was the antithesis of everything I was and loved I was not yet aware of the irony that the dreaded Margaret was the creative catalyst for so much of what my generation was listening to and watching It is hard to imagine Mrs Thatcher laughing along to Elton or Alexei Sayle but without her it is doubtful there would have been the emergence of alternative comedy Thatcher was such a titanic political presence and her political opponents seemed so puny in comparison that it was almost as if the massed ranks of comedians and musicians and writers took it upon themselves to act as her unofficial opposition While she was in power the most notable artists to support her openly were Philip Larkin Gilbert George and Jim Davidson Meanwhile the roster of rock bands who recorded songs in which Thatcher or the Tories were the enemy is an impressive one a playlist call it Now That s Why I Hate Tories would include Margaret on the Guillotine by the Smiths Ghost Town by the Specials the Jam s A Town Called Malice Elvis Costello s Tramp the Dirt Down and Shipbuilding The The s Heartland and pretty much everything by Billy Bragg For better or worse Thatcher was a muse to a whole generation of comedians and songwriters an inspiring villain or an easy butt for jokes The Jam Town Called Malice on MUZU TV In politics and on the world stage Thatcher was a mesmerising figure Curiously she seemed least convincing in those rare moments when she interacted with popular culture I can still recall her excruciating appearance in 1987 on the BBC children s show Saturday Superstore when she was required to pass judgment on the new single from Pepsi Shirlie For one chilling moment she attempted to dance to the song the beat of which she summed up as thump thump thump but she looked like she would have been far more at ease closing down a coal mine She was hopeless at delivering jokes the only thing deader than the dead parrot she referred to in a 1990 conference speech in which she did her Monty Python impression at the expense of the Liberal Democrats was her delivery of the joke She was on surer ground when on her home territory of politics and there she was predominant Great drama demands strong characters compelling conflicts and a palpable sense of jeopardy and risk Thatcher and her government fulsomely satisfied all three conditions These were years of economic turbulence and social upheaval widespread unemployment the last days of mining the rise of the yuppie and mass home ownership and race riots It is perhaps not surprising that these were also years when writers such as John Sullivan Alan Bleasdale Ken Loach Dennis Potter and Jimmy McGovern were able to create some of the defining television drama of the Eighties Without Thatcher Yosser Hughes wouldn t have been saying gissa job on Boys from the Blackstuff there would have been no Arthur Daley and Del Boy wouldn t have been telling Rodney that this time next year they d be millionaires While much of Thatcher s impact on the arts was accidental some was the product of legislation she passed When she came to power there were only three television channels By the time she left office Sky television had been established there were a plethora of independent television production companies and a fourth channel that had become for the Eighties at least a home for edgy innovative films and programming The early Eighties also saw a radical new wave of experimental black film collectives which were often supported by Channel 4 formed in response to the increasing racial tension and social unrest in what was even then known as Thatcher s Britain The political rationale behind the decision to open up television was rooted in Thatcher s faith in free market competition the consequence was that writers such as Kureishi whose My Beautiful Laundrette was produced by Channel 4 and comedians like Jimmy Mulville who set up the influential Hat Trick production

s auction of 70 masks fetched some 930 000 euros after a legal challenge to stop the sale failed Lawyers for the Hopi tribe had asked for the auction to be cancelled on the grounds that the masks must have been stolen from the tribe It considers them sacred and blessed with divine spirits Auctioneers however say the masks had been bought and sold in the past and were legally acquired They said blocking the sale would have implications for the trade of indigenous art and could potentially force French museums to hand back collections they have bought The masks mysterious looking faces fashioned from wood leather horse hair and feathers and painted in a vivid array of colours are spiritual artefacts thought to have been taken from a reservation in northern Arizona in the 1930s and 40s To Hopi Indians they are sacred tools through which the living can communicate with the spirits of the dead The sale of sacred Indian artefacts has been outlawed in the United States since 1990 but the law does not extend to sales overseas Protesters repeatedly disrupted Friday s auction As the Mother Crow mask was sold one protester shouted These are sacred things One mask was bought by an association to give back to the Hopis said the Drouot auction house One buyer who acquired four masks said he was delighted to be adding to his collection of Hopi artefacts One day I might give some back the collector who declined to be identified told Reuters news agency But if it had not been for collectors in the 19th Century who contributed to the field of ethnology there would very little

describes himself as their close friend Before the court ruling he wrote that the masks belong to the Hopi and the Hopi alone To auction these would be in my opinion a sacrilege a criminal gesture that contains grave moral repercussions he said Survival International s Jonathan Mazower The Hopi people are deeply distressed I would hope that these sacred items can be returned to the Hopi tribe where they belong They are not for auction The legal proceedings were brought by the organisation Survival International which defends the rights of tribal peoples The US Ambassador to France Charles Rivkin has also said he is very concerned about the sale However auctioneer Gilles Neret Minet of auction house Neret Minet Tessier Sarrou had warned that a ruling to stop the sale could potentially force French museums to empty out their collections If we lose this case there will be no more sales of objects of indigenous art in France he said before the court ruling The Paris court sided with the French auction house saying there were no grounds to stop sale because the items were acquired legally by a French collector during a 30 year stay in the US", "A former winner of TV s The

employment tribunal at the East London Tribunal Centre he had no case to answer and Ms English was effectively blackmailing him Following the unanimous ruling in his favour he tweeted A victory for the law against the claim culture In a written judgment Judge John Warren said This was a claim which should never have been brought There was no assurance or suggestion that the winner would receive direct mentoring from Lord Sugar The claimant was clear herself about this she knew full well the job she would do at Viglen when she accepted the prize She told the nation on the BBC Breakfast TV show He said Ms English had the wrong idea about how glamorous the role would be and had stated in her evidence that she believed previous winners of the show had accompanied Lord Sugar in his private jet Lord Sugar There was never a case to answer The tribunal believes that the claimant had in her mind that having won The Apprentice the role would be much more glamorous and that she would be working alongside Lord Sugar as his assistant Mr Warren said Ms English from Whitstable Kent told the tribunal she was given a desk and a phone but no specific duties during a four month probationary period She said her boss Bordan Tkachuk looked at her with contempt on her first day and said There is no job Ms English said she carried out basic administrative tasks but did not say anything to Lord Sugar because she did not want to be a troublemaker The 2010 Apprentice winner resigned from Viglen in May 2011 and then felt pressurised into taking up a new position at Lord Sugar s internet set top box company YouView she told the hearing I m afraid she underestimated me and her reputation is now in tatters Lord Sugar said he was trying to help her out by offering her a new position because she had complained of being desperate for money The judge found that Ms English was given a real job at Viglen with enormous scope for advancement and learning The Viglen role was specifically selected for the claimant to expand and build on her already acknowledged experience and ability he said The respondent Lord Sugar had gone out of his way to ensure the claimant was placed in a role at YouView from which she could learn new skills a job which she agreed to and which she enjoyed doing In a statement after the tribunal s judgement Lord Sugar said There was never a case for us to answer but her need for money and fame meant that the whole system was subjected to this charade I have been cleared of a derisory attempt to smear my name and extract money from me The allegations were without substance and I believe this case was brought with one intention in mind the presumption that I would not attend the tribunal that I would not testify and that I would settle out of court

career has seen him win two Oscars and marry four women Now however he has spoken of how his career has been driven by the vacuum of a loveless upbringing which he felt was finally healed when he was knighted by the Queen The Oscar winner said there was an absence of affection in his family and that his mother herself an actress felt jealous of his success Sir Ben 69 was born Krishna Bhanji in Scarborough and brought up in Salford His father Rahimtulla Harji Banjhi was a doctor of Gujurati descent his mother Anna Lyna Mary was an English model and actress However in an interview to be published in next week s Seven magazine he said that he was brought up without a feeling of love and that it was only through acting that he began to heal those wounds Ben Kingsley My father died in a cloud of alcohol Ben Kingsley interview dark soul of the knight Actor Sir Ben Kingsley is not a fan of Twitter I had always been the song and dance man of the family he says I remember my father referring to me as our little Danny Kaye when I was about seven That was the only remotely positive comment I remember from them They never praised me or acknowledged a gram of talent in me at all Their way was to mock when are you going to finish with this acting lark that sort of thing My mother far from being proud was very jealous of my success Kaye was a Hollywood actor and comedian known mostly for his physical comedy dancing and nonsense songs Sir Ben s father died aged 54 and his mother in 2010 aged 96 However Sir Ben said that he only felt healed of the scars of his childhood when he became a knight in 2002 for services to acting The investiture ceremony was carried out at Buckingham Palace by the Queen and he said that it made him feel that he had received approval and affection for the first time His mother was not present at the investiture I told you about my parents and the fact that any kind of embrace was totally absent from my life he said So to be embraced by Her Majesty I felt like stopping people in the street saying my mum loves me you know Because that s what it felt like to me The filling of a vacuum in the universe Sir Ben had previously spoken of his father s heavy drinking and his difficult relationship with his mother but had never told in full of his loveless childhood Three years ago he said of her She had a circuit missing That made her distant And somewhat baffled by her four children two girls and two boys Sir Ben s older brother became a doctor while Sir Ben himself did not attend university or drama school Instead he was given work by Sir Trevor Nunn at the Royal Shakespeare Company which he said began to make up for his childhood That became my family my education my university my language my embrace my tribe he said In Shakespeare we see archetypal patterns of human behaviour that are flawlessly rendered which comfort us provoke us offer us explanations and which I ve been attempting to pass on in every role that I do since Sir Ben has been married four times first to Angela Morant whom he married in 1966 and divorced in 1972 and with whom he has a daughter Jasmine and a son Thomas then to Alison Sutcliffe the theatre director with whom he has two sons thirdly to Alexandra Christmann whom he divorced in 2005 after pictures emerged of her kissing another man and finally to Daniela Lavender a Brazilian born

Hamlet and Troilus and Cressida while Edmund has appeared in Clarence in Richard III and Chatilllon in King John One s just had a huge season at the National the other at the RSC he said In contrast to the attitude of my own parents when they finish a piece of work and I m in the same building their ribs are in danger of being crushed It was a huge relief to me to see they had the gift and they have a genuine appetite for it Sir Ben also uses the interview to deny a long standing rumour that he insists on the use of his title The claim has dogged him for more than a decade but he categorically denied it It was a scurrilous story in a magazine abroad and I continue to be the victim of it he said", "By Gavin Fuller 6 50PM BST 13 Apr 2013 Comments At last The only major monsters

with the Doctor and Clara coming to the fore and gratifyingly using words rather than violence to save the day In fact words were key as Cold War s writer Mark Gatiss gave Clara some truly excellent dialogue as she began to reflect on the responsibilities that travelling with the Doctor entails Less successful was the characterisation of the Russian characters David Warner s Professor Grisenko

violence Cinema manager Tian Zaixing said he could not recall any other imported film being halted on the opening day He said the cinema had received a call at 10 00 local time to cancel the film We had high expectations for this film s box office he added They didn t tell us when the film would be shown again an official at a Shanghai cinema told Reuters Sony Pictures executive Zhang Miao said the changes to the film included tuning the blood to a darker colour and lowering the height of the splatter of blood in an interview with China s Southern Metropolis Daily Tarantino viewed the changes as progress rather than a compromise according to Zhang Sony Pictures and China s State Administration of Radio Film and Television SARFT which is responsible for movie censorship have not

But how do they know which tree will make a top quality violin A wander through the forest with a master tree picker gives an idea of the enormous experience and instinct required Just any tree will not do when combing a forest in Switzerland for the perfect musical wood its age the weather and even the position of the moon help to craft the warmest fullest notes Lorenzo Pellegrini shook his head and walked away knee deep in snow He was not going to waste his time on that tree Too many branches Branches mean knots in the wood And knots in the wood spoil its resonance Pellegrini is a tree

in these mountains they grow so slowly sometimes they stop growing altogether They just gather strength There are trees up here that are a thousand years old he says His blue eyes are wide with wonderment Can you believe that Pellegrini has been working the Risoud Forest since he was nine Growing up in Italy s Abruzzo mountains he and his family would go deep into the woods each year hours and hours from the nearest village build a cabin to live in and stay there for eight months cutting down trees chopping up logs I used to give my leftover polenta to the wolves he says When he was 30 he discovered the Risoud Forest and never wanted to leave Now 83 he still climbs trees like a squirrel and tends the forest as if it were his garden weeding out the beech trees that would smother his precious spruces For the trees to grow slowly and regularly you have to let them grow close together like the hair on your head he says And there should not be too much water The tree s heart should stay dry That gives the best wood Solid Enormous resonance he adds Pellegrini gardens the forest as he puts it But he gardens for people who will not be born for hundreds of years So that there will

Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook", "Malawi s President Joyce Banda was incandescent with anger over a statement labelling US singer Madonna a bully the BBC has learnt She was unaware of the harshly critical statement that was issued by her office following Madonna s recent visit to the country senior officials have said The statement accused Madonna of exaggerating her contribution to the country and demanding VIP treatment Madonna who was visiting her charity in Malawi hit back at the criticisms She described them as lies and said she began her involvement in Malawi seven years ago with honourable intentions A well placed source told the BBC that President Banda was incandescent with anger when she heard about the statement and a senior official has confirmed she knew nothing about it The statement issued on Wednesday accused the star of wanting Malawi to be forever chained to the obligation of gratitude It claimed Madonna believed the government should have rolled out a red carpet and blast the 21 gun salute upon her arrival in Malawi Granted Madonna is a famed international musician But that does not impose an injunction of obligation on any government to give her state treatment Such treatment even if she deserved it is discretionary not obligatory the statement said And in reference to a row over whether she is building schools or classrooms it said she needs to learn as a matter of urgency the decency of telling the truth Emily Banda head of Malawi s NGO board said that although President Banda did not approve or indeed know about the statement there would be no apology for the mistake Some of the criticism of Madonna s charity work was justified she said Madonna who has adopted two children from Malawi originally planned to build an 15m 9 9m girls academy I have no reason to question Madonna s motives in Malawi it s also pretty clear that President Banda s office has handled a messy situation with staggering ineptitude But two years ago she closed down the Malawian office of her charity Raising Malawi which was headed by President Joyce Banda s sister Anjimile Mtila Oponyo who now works at the education ministry and opted to fund 10 schools instead Earlier this month Malawi s education minister Eunice Kazembe said Madonna was building classrooms not entire schools in the country She has built classrooms at existing schools really it s a difference in terminology the minister said Trevor Neilson who is now managing Raising Malawi projects said 400 000 had been spent on building the 10 school blocks allowing some 4 000 children who had been learning under trees to be taught in classrooms On Thursday Raising Malawi put out a statement saying that Madonna did not ever ask or demand special treatment at the airport or elsewhere during her visit She said she saw with my own eyes the 10 new primary schools in Kasungu province that Raising Malawi completed this year Madonna is not letting politics stand in the way of her deep commitment to help build schools there and educate as many children as possible the statement also said", "Listening to new music is rewarding for the brain a study suggests Using MRI scans a Canadian team of scientists found that areas in the reward centre of the brain became active when people heard a song for the first time The more the listener enjoyed what they were hearing the stronger the connections were in the region of the brain called the nucleus accumbens The study is published in the journal Science Dr Valorie Salimpoor from the Rotman Research Institute in Toronto told the BBC s Science in Action programme We know that the nucleus accumbens is involved with reward But music is abstract It s not like you are really hungry and you are about to get a piece of food and you are really excited about it because you are going to eat it or the same thing applies to sex or money that s when you would normally see activity in the nucleus accumbens But what s cool is that you re anticipating and getting excited over something entirely abstract and that s the next sound that is coming up New tunes To carry out the study which took place at the Montreal Neurological Institute at McGill University the scientists played 19 volunteers 60 excerpts of new music based on their musical preferences As they were listening to the 30 second long tracks they had to the opportunity to buy the ones they liked in a mocked up online music store All of this was carried out while the participants were lying in an MRI machine By analysing the scans the scientists found that the nucleus accumbens was lighting up and depending on the level of activity the researchers could predict whether the participant was likely to buy a song Dr Salimpoor said As they are listening to this music we can look at their brain activity and figure out how they are appreciating or enjoying this music before they even tell us anything And that s part of this new direction that neuroscience is going in trying to understand what people are thinking and inferring their thoughts and motivations and eventually their behaviour through their brain activity The researchers found that the nucleus accumbens was also interacting with another region of the brain called the auditory cortical stores This is an area that stores sound information based on music that people have been exposed to before This part of the brain will be unique for each individual because we ve all heard different music in the past explained Dr Salimpoor The researchers now want to find out how this drives our music tastes and whether our brain activity can explain why people are drawn to different styles of music You can hear more about this research on the BBC World Service programme Science in Action a schedule of

15m purpose built theatre but in recent years has been in crisis Founder Mike Bradwell talks about returning after three decades Hull in 1971 was Mike Bradwell says the least likely place in the world to start an experimental theatre company So he started one We lived in what essentially was a squat and our office was the telephone box outside Bradwell recalls I suppose you could describe us if you wanted to be uncharitable as a bunch of hippies I wanted to make theatre about the kind of people we were and the kind of people we knew There were not many plays being made that reflected the problems tribulations and politics of our generation So we created plays And the name Hull Truck came from Hull and travelled about in a truck Oh We started out by basically stealing a van and we found the props in skips The company s early existence was capricious and precarious Their breakthrough came in 1974 when they took a play to the Bush Theatre in London and returning to the Bush with every new play for the next decade Hull Truck became a national force Bradwell left in 1982 and Hull Truck flourished under his successor John Godber whose plays like Bouncers and Up n Under earned the company Olivier Awards Los Angeles Critics Circle Awards and commercial success After 26 years at the helm Godber left in 2010 a year after the company moved into its shiny 15m home just a mile from the original squat But the company began to struggle burdened by increased costs from the new building and declining income It was lambasted for abolishing the post of artistic director and received 1m in emergency Arts Council England funding last year to keep it afloat A new artistic director has just been appointed in Mark Babych the chief executive has left and new managers are attempting to reverse the decline Hull s a very big ship and it s been if you like sailing through some very stormy waters Bradwell says It will take a certain time to turn it around The idea of having an artistic director at the helm of a theatre is exactly how it should be as opposed to an executive producer Against this backdrop Bradwell is returning to direct the comedy Queen of the Nile his first main house play for the company for 30 years Bradwell who was artistic director of the Bush Theatre from 1996 2007 believes a new generation with the same drive and ethos as his original troupe is now emerging to shake up the status quo I think the political climate and economic climate are such that rather than waiting for somebody to give you a job groups of young actors writers and directors rather like we did in 1971 are getting together and making their own theatre and getting in the back of vans and doing it he says He points to the Hull based Middle Child whose manifesto says society is in a precarious situation and declares the desire to make work that speaks to our generation about important issues Bradwell also says the most recent crop of graduates at the drama school where he teaches have gone on to form six new companies They are little companies with the same spirit as I started out with going out and making theatre because nobody s going to employ them to do it he says At a time when many regional theatres are warning of dire consequences of government and council funding cuts could the hard times actually stimulate a new burst of creativity You can sort of either make good theatre on no money or lots of money Bradwell replies There will always be people for whom theatre is not a job it s a way of life And it won t make any difference whether they re at the Royal National Theatre with a grant of 25bn a year sic or they are in Hull in a squat He is though quick to add that non commercial theatres do need a subsidy to survive You are not going to get experimental and provocative work unless you have some sort of support to make it happen Bradwell s new play Queen of the Nile is funny and bawdy more than experimental and provocative In the play we follow Debbie a forty something Yorkshire woman who yearns for a new life and discovers sex tourism in Luxor Egypt It also stars Dudley Sutton Tinker from TV classic Lovejoy as a camp restaurant owner and beneath the surface floats issues like tourist exploitation inter cultural relationships and the Arab Spring Bradwell went to see Luxor for himself just after Christmas What I discovered was that virtually everybody there was from the north of England and an awful lot of people from Yorkshire he says It s almost like people used to go to Blackpool then Torremolinos now they go to Luxor It s Blackpool with archaeology The play a sauced up Shirley Valentine was written by Luxor regular Tim Fountain He is best known for Sex Addict a show in which he would ask the audience to choose a man for him to sleep with from an internet sex site every night Fountain recalls the inspiration for Queen of the Nile an Englishwoman in Luxor in her 60s or 70s who told him I love it here because the beer s cheap the men are cheap and they ve got Emmerdale on satellite Fountain says It made me laugh so much that I though oh my God there really is a play in this Queen of the Nile

interested in astronomy so much as astronomers he says The observatory is part of the Welsh entry to this year s Venice Biennale and will be shown for six months in a former convent Galileo presented his first telescope in Venice Williams will now present his own homage to the amateur astronomer a temple to a nocturnal sub species He has called his installation The Starry Messenger a translation of the title of Galileo s 1610 text Sidereus Nuncius Williams who is 6ft 3in with a gap in his teeth like Jimmy Tarbuck s recalls driving through north Wales as a boy with his dad one starry night It was cold and we had the sun roof open I looked up and said Bloody hell it s amazing There s a lot of unknown out there And Dad said It doesn t pay to think about that too much Williams heroes are

garden Both men recently appeared with Williams at a convention of stargazers and astrophysicists in Cardiff where the artist performed a piece called The Astronomer He invited the audience to imagine themselves as moles crawling in through the cat flap of a domestic semi to spy on an astronomer who is standing in the kitchen admiring his own observatory Where does his obsession come from It s got all the trappings of a less important hobby he explains the glorified shed in the back garden But there s something charming about it too As the sun goes down these things come on People around the world become an eye looking out And it s one of the few hobbies that is important for science amateur astronomers spot comets because the professionals are too busy to do the donkey work Williams wants his installation to be a corrective to the contemporary derision for hobbyists be they trainspotters Airfix junkies or astronomers We re in a dark age and humour and entertainment are the problem he says We make fun of the wrong people His contention is that the alternative comedy scene put new targets in the crosshairs In the 1980s it became OK to make fun of trainspotters and other weirdos He cites an early 1990s Punt and Dennis sketch about a character called Milky Milky They were making fun of people with mental illness That s not telling a joke it s just pointing The best comedy reveals something you didn t know rather than confirming your assumptions He says this with feeling having been part of a derided sub species himself as a boy growing up in Colwyn Bay north Wales he was a model railway enthusiast The snooker club were rude to us he recalls reopening a psychic wound The problem was that the snooker club and the model railway club shared the same premises

eat it He once built a Teasmade that drowned a model Welsh village in tea every morning to represent the Welsh reservoirs built to provide water for England That witty engagement with his homeland is a hallmark Williams has also operated a mobile nightclub in the back of a caravan called the Blaenau Vista Social Club taken a self portrait as a sheep farmer in Welsh homage to the painter Caspar David Friedrich and another dressed in Birkenstocks harp and fake beard for a project called Bard Attitude Behind the buffoonery Williams is always making a serious point as the Guardian s Adrian Searle pointed out when selecting him as one of Britain s most promising artists in 2004 His serious point in The Starry Messenger is that Britain has lost a valuable hobby culture What happens to our Heath Robinsons our Fred Dibnahs while everyone else chillaxes to Scandi noir or Ant and Dec What has happened to the great British eccentric Fittingly we are discussing these questions in Williams garden shed in Rhostryfan a village above Caernarfon in north Wales His house he says was built in anticipation of a 19th century slate rush that never came In the abandoned quarries above his house they filmed portions of Tomb Raider further up in the mountains Darwin went on the geological hikes that would prove so important in the development of his theory of natural selection He bought the shed on eBay for 500 and assembled it with his dad getting a nasty scar on his chest in the process a badge of honour Williams says that since he erected the shed six weeks ago the men in the village have taken him more seriously It is a big affair with galvanised steel walls to protect it from Welsh wetness and space not just for a drawing board and computer but a fine collection of books by the artist s comedy heroes Tommy Cooper and Peter Cook It s an artist s studio and like Montaigne s tower room or George Bernard Shaw s rotating shed a refuge from the quotidian world There s even a skylight though disappointingly no telescope He tells me how much he admires the cover art for the Blur album Modern Life is Rubbish This is not all that surprising it s an oil painting of a LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard steam locomotive But with Williams there is a sense that modern life has indeed turned out to be rubbish I m interested in the last embers of the time before uPVC he says at one point And later Morrissey was right when he said it was all over for Britain when the first McDonald s opened Williams powers up his computer and takes me on a virtual tour of his Venice installation Visitors will be in the dark as they stroll around the model observatory but will hear birdsong and other ambient noise to simulate a suburban garden at night There will also be the sound of weeping though whether it s weeping for joy or sorrow won t be clear he says He wants a mood of contemplation I used to go to chapel twice a day and the experience was of zoning out I want visitors to experience that The view of the observatory will be obscured by curtains of theatrical scrim depicting terrazzo a composite material used to make kitchen flooring which was devised in Venice as a way of using up surplus marble chippings This links up Williams explains with his interest in cosmic dust It s about looking into the great beyond and the microscopic as well The stars and dust at the same time Beyond the observatory there will be a koi carp pond filled with polyurethane terrazzo floating on top A sound recordist in Anglesey has recorded ice cubes clinking in his bath that you ll hear as you look at the pond But polyurethane wouldn t clink I know laughs Williams But I love that disconnect like when you re played bat noises which by definition you can t hear In the next room of the installation visitors will confront a giant coffee table You re below Williams explains Above there are 101 household things vases coins vacuum cleaners It will look like a kind of solar system This is very Bedwyr Williams a domesticated cosmos or domesticity celebrated on a cosmic scale depending on your point of view What Venice and the art world will make of The Starry Messenger is anybody s guess What Williams makes of the Biennale is a matter of public record In 2005 he spent three months there as Wales s artist in residence and recorded the miserable experience in a rueful diary called Basta Italian for enough It wasn t so much the art world he was lampooning but his role in it He s comfortable doing that He has published a book of all his performance scripts and crib sheets entitled Bedwyr I Think I Missed Your Performance anatomising his failure to be a player in the globalised art world through an inability to speak the lingua franca of the curator fear of flying ineptitude at holding on to taxi receipts his non metropolitan awkwardness This time Williams will go to Venice not to send himself up but in the hope that The Starry Messenger will shock and awe I want to do something big so that people ask How did they get all this from Wales The answer is that it will be shipped in a flat pack and then reassembled If it works it will be as unexpectedly sublime as the stars seen through the sun roof of his dad s car The Starry Messenger will be at the Ludoteca Santa Maria Ausiliatrice Venice from 1 June to 24 November Details labiennale org",

out of the shadows say campaigners The BBC soap is running a storyline about a girl who has undergone the procedure and is trying to protect her younger sister from the same fate The younger girl is threatened with being taken abroad to her extended family for cutting and later with being subjected to it in the UK FGM has been in the shadows here in this country said Efua Dorkenoo of Equality Now one of the leading campaigners against the practice Because of that we as a country are not really grappling hard with the fact that it is happening here There are thought to be 20 000 girls at risk of FGM living in the UK although the figures are now old and 66 000 women who have been subjected to it The practice has been illegal here since 1995 but it was not until 2003 that a loophole that allowed parents to take their children abroad for FGM was closed Casualty s contribution is to give voice to children whose needs are not being addressed and bringing the whole issue into the living room said Dorkenoo It will contribute to bringing down the walls of silence and taboo around it The scriptwriter Sasha Hails says she was inspired to write the episode by a girl who she and other mothers of children at a London primary school suspected had been subjected to FGM We became aware that this little girl disappeared for the summer and when she came back she wasn t quite right Hails said She needed to keep going to the loo and she was just different We were a group of mums in the playground we put two and two together We knew it was terrible and we talked about it amongst ourselves but no one ever did anything about it None of us even dared to talk to her mother It seemed such a personal thing and it really stayed in my head that this horrific thing had happened and by not doing anything we were complicit in allowing it to happen Nimco Ali who was taken to Somalia at seven for FGM and is co founder of the campaign group Daughters of Eve was an adviser to the programme My personal aim is to afford young women the same privileges that I had and for them to understand that within them there is great potential she said In order for that to happen we need to all stand together and empower them As the character Tamasha says on Casualty quoting a young women we have worked with It never stops hurting It is always painful Let us not deepen that pain by undermining the bravery of those woman and girls that come forward not only to tell their stories but also to live a life of their choosing If I could wish for one thing to change as a result of the Casualty episode it would be for everyone to see the child in front of us as a girl asking for help and not part of an other culture", "Treatment Room 1983 In Richard Hamilton s installation Thatcher

other day when Stephen Fry mentioned that the thing about the hair on your head is that you have to get it cut every three months Personally I found this quite reassuring Four times a year is precisely my own average too for trips to the hairdresser But I could imagine the fleeting confusion of a lot of people watching Three months Stephen I thought everyone went once a fortnight At the other end of the scale a female novelist recently admitted in a print interview that she never washes her own hair which is long and beautiful preferring to pay 24 to a hairdresser Admittedly she didn t say how often the hair needed washing but one naturally assumes it s at least two or three times a week A number of questions urgently presented themselves Does the 24 include the tip Is this novelist s next book actually set in a hairdressing salon thus making all those payments of 24 tax deductible Is 24 a standard amount Is there possibly someone in the area who would do it for less than 24 What does it say about me that I routinely wash my own hair Am I some sort of cheapskate Why am I so fixated on this 24 I expect there are surveys for this sort of thing how often you go to the hairdresser s how much you spend each month on clothes We all tend to think we are within the range of normal and then discover to our astonishment that we are either a crazy profligates or b sluts But is it helpful to know where we are on the spectrum I have just discovered from my water metering bill that my house is well below average on single occupant water usage and it made me terribly proud for about five minutes and then it set me worrying Am I not using the washing machine as much as other people Should I be taking more baths eek Should I be running the taps every day for some other reason a reason that is currently obscure to me but evidently a matter of daily routine to other people with meters And that s another thing Since meters aren t obligatory in this area people only opt for them if they consider themselves exceptionally low users Yet somehow they still all use more water than I do What is it that I am neglecting to do Based on no research at all just hunches I reckon I m at the high end of podcast downloading off the bottom end of the scale on shoe purchase very high on voluble hankering for an idealised or illusory golden age of considerate behaviour towards strangers But do I want to be judged against normal I m not sure Last week I foolishly agreed to wear a blood pressure monitor for 24 hours and I absolutely hated it For one thing it was very uncomfortable Every half hour the cuff strapped tightly around my left bicep would inflate and squeeze all the life out of my arm leaving my left hand flopping about on the keyboard like a dying trout My mistake of course was to try to carry on working I ended up with a lot of ddskdczfcaac stuff as my left hand pawed feebly at the keys But the point is that every half hour I got a new reading and I didn t like it I didn t like being measured and evaluated even for legitimate health reasons I didn t like it that my results would ultimately be put on a scale and judged no doubt harshly against normal And yet it s fascinating I m a relatively low water user At the same time I m proudly in the top two per cent for getting angry at cyclists who ignore traffic lights and ride on the pavement And in a world where apparently people go to the hairdresser s three times a week because they have more money than sense I m with Stephen Fry in the lowest quartile reckoning the current haircut will definitely see us nicely through to the season after Pentecost What worries me most is still the water usage What is it that other people are using all that water for Think Think This mystery thing has to be something that uses lots of water and that is somehow completely off my radar as a home activity I m seeing jets of water Good grief I ve just thought It isn t colonic

accustomed to coming second But after The X Factor was beaten in the ratings by Strictly Come Dancing and his latest ITV show Food Glorious Food was his lowest rating launch ever the TV and music mogul is banking on the return of his other Saturday night talent show Britain s Got Talent to prove he still has the Midas touch Cowell raised the stakes even further by pitching Britain s Got Talent back on ITV for its seventh series up against its BBC1 talent show rival The Voice Cowell needs both Britain s Got Talent and The X Factor on top form as he negotiates a new output deal with ITV for its two biggest entertainment shows His current three year contract with ITV worth a reported 20m ends this year The audience for the final of last year s X Factor was the lowest since 2006 with a series that was widely regarded as lacklustre and a judging panel headed by Gary Barlow in urgent need of fresh faces Food Glorious Food which critics said was an attempt to cash in on the success of BBC2 s The Great British Bake Off attracted fewer than 3 million viewers when it launched in February It was Cowell admitted disappointing The TV producer and presenter worth an estimated 225m was back on safer ground last week away from the food aisles of Marks Spencer where the winner of Food Glorious Food will have their dish on the shelves at the launch of Britain s Got Talent which has been brought forward an hour to go head to head with BBC1 s The Voice You ve got to remember that they brought this show to the UK two years ago to compete with us said Cowell last week We were there already on Saturday nights They re the ones that wanted a competition we never asked for it It s their problem not my problem Britain s Got Talent was rejuvenated in 2012 by adding David Walliams to the judging panel alongside Amanda Holden and former Strictly Come Dancing judge Alesha Dixon with the Little Britain star striking up an unlikely double act with Cowell He was said Cowell like his mother s old dachshund Always humping my leg The new series brings a familiar mix of wannabes no hopers and genuinely outstanding talent marshalled by ITV s two other big stars Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly It s as much about people as it is about the talent If you didn t know their back stories or you didn t like them they were just acts then the show would be boring But they always seem to do a good job of finding people you root for said Cowell We all live in a world let s be honest where everybody wants to be famous now and I think that s quite fun There was no discernible trace of irony from the man who has done more to create this phenomenon than any other But there were also signs in the new series that the talent in Britain at least may be drying up judging by the opening audition show with a contestant from the Netherlands and the most memorable act a shadow theatre troupe from Hungary Another contestant 14 year old stand up comic Jack Carroll who has cerebral palsy previously appeared on ITV s Pride of Britain Awards A lot of people have been on other shows and I don t have a problem with that said Cowell If somebody needs a bigger platform we will encourage them On the show s overseas contestants he added I don t think you should always be competing with yourselves We are part of Europe now it s flattering they fly all this way to enter the show To me it didn t matter It means our Brits have got to step up Last year s Britain s Got Talent was won by a Brit albeit of the four legged variety Pudsey the dog and her trainer Ashleigh Butler It remains to be seen whether viewers are ready for an overseas winner With 13 million viewers the Britain s Got Talent final was the ninth most watched TV show of last year though naturally behind the Olympics Euro 2012 football and the Queen s Diamond Jubilee concert events that will not be around in 2013 to challenge it for the UK ratings top spot This season the producers have done an amazing job I would put a pretty good bet this won t be the last of the series Cowell said of the new series However he promised that the day it starts to become boring trust me we ll stop", "Until the late 1970s the Square Mile was a genteel all male club dominated by pinstripe suits public school accents and a culture of long lunches Money was made at the Stock Exchange with effortless panache as a coterie of licensed dealers acted on behalf of stockbroker firms with redolent names such as Quilter and Co The Big Bang blew the ancien regime apart Within six months of Margaret Thatcher s election exchange controls were lifted and foreign capital flooded into Britain The deregulation of the Stock Exchange in 1986 was an invitation to the world s biggest beasts to enter the trading floor Traders began to send huge amounts of money fizzing around the world s financial networks The towers of Canary Wharf rose silver and immaculate from the industrial desert of the former London Docklands The capital began its journey to world financial domination The crash of five years ago cast a shadow on the free for all spirit that the Big Bang let rip But Thatcher s deregulatory push created the new internationally focused City For better and for worse it hasn t looked back At the start of this decade the financial sector was estimated to be worth 125 4bn or 9 4 in gross value to the UK economy As part of a famous television ad campaign from September 1986 an ordinary looking bloke is shown in a fictional village pub Lost in thought he almost knocks a passing postman from his bike It turns out he is preoccupied with the news that he can buy shares in British Gas After passing on the good news to the postie he adds If you see Sid tell him The age of Sid was not simply a PR myth Initially there really was a popular scramble by ordinary folk to sign up to the people s capitalism and reap the rewards Four million people applied for British Gas shares at 135p a pop with a minimum purchase

BP water and electricity would follow Thatcher said that privatisation was a chance to give power back to the people In fact as Robert Philpot director of the Progress pressure group wrote last week Now in 2012 it s clear that the result of electricity privatisation was to take power away from the people Small British shareholders have no influence over the overwhelmingly non British owners of the firms that generate and distribute power in Britain Saatchi and Saatchi s Labour isn t working political poster apparently featuring a long dole queue made up of actors became perhaps the most famous in the nation s history British electioneering was changed for ever When Britain s first female prime minister was in her pomp northern football fans travelling to away games in London would be taunted by home supporters waving wads of 10 and 20 notes The brutal repartee of the terraces expressed a fundamental truth of the Thatcher period the north suffered the worst of the deep recession and high unemployment of the early years and it benefited least from the eventual boom of the late 1980s It would be wrong to say that Thatcher planned the decline of the north s most vital industries and sources of employment In fact northern England suffered precisely from the absence of a plan in Westminster In 1985 explaining why she believed regional planning in Britain was a non starter Thatcher said If we try to discourage development and economic growth in large parts of the south of England in the hope that it will happen in the large cities in the north we risk losing them altogether Left to its own devices the British economy rebalanced irrevocably to the south Employment in the manufacturing industry vital to the north s wellbeing slumped falling from 7 1 million in 1979 to 4 4m in 1993 Services and the booming City eventually took up much of the economic slack but the good times were happening in the south Thatcher came to power ready to take on the the National Union of Mineworkers which had humiliated her Tory predecessor Edward Heath during the 1970s The miners strike of 1984 85 allowed her to destroy the power of the NUM and institute a series of legal obstacles to industrial action which she believed had bedevilled Britain in the 70s Meanwhile the decline in Britain s manufacturing industry which Thatcher s government did little to reverse destroyed the power bases of British trades unionism High unemployment and recession critically weakened the unions bargaining power in the early to mid 1980s Since 1980 union membership in Britain has halved A backlash by the Christian right meant that Thatcher s shops bill designed to allow Sunday trading was voted down in 1986 It was her only defeat on an entire bill in the Commons But the road to deregulation for shops and pubs had begun After the second world war British politics seemed to have come to a lasting settlement on the fundamentals of running the country Both the Conservatives and Labour cherished the mixed economy balanced between public and private ownership Pragmatism was the order of the day as union leaders such as Jack Jones and Joe Gormley enjoyed beer and sandwiches at No 10 Economic policy was forged through achieving tripartite consensus between employers unions and the government of the day The winter of discontent sounded the knell for that way of doing things Thatcher arrived in power armed with the free market philosophy of Ronald Reagan s adviser Milton Friedman Managers must be allowed to manage became the mantra and a new style of politics was born The rise of the City of London and its new money focused ethos spawned its own style Designer labels came of age suited to the new aspirational spirit Actresses such as Joan Collins a Thatcher admirer in the American glamour soaps Dallas and Dynasty patented the look for would be female power dressers Shoulder pads and sharply tailored suits ruled Thatcher swore by her blue skirt suit pearls and Asprey handbag a look that was to influence powerful women from Hillary Clinton to Condoleezza Rice Among republicans in Northern Ireland Thatcher is loathed for her intransigence during the Maze prison hunger strike of 1981 which led to the death of Bobby Sands But four years later she appalled unionists by signing the Anglo Irish agreement which gave the Republic of Ireland a say in the affairs of the north paving the way for the Good Friday peace agreement of 1998 Thatcher s education secretary from 1986 89 Kenneth Baker transformed the state school system creating a proto market that is being enthusiastically embraced and developed by one of his successors Michael Gove Baker insisted that attainment levels be made public allowing a league table of schools to emerge At the same time he instructed schools to accept all applicants local or otherwise unless already full The choice agenda was born parents could in theory if not always in practice decide which school their child would go to Local authority control of education was also much reduced by the Education Act of 1988 which gave autonomy over budgets and appointments to heads and school governors Gove has deepened that autonomy with his academy programme and added the further option of free schools Thatcher had no interest in football despite occasional cringeworthy photo ops such as the pose outside No 10 with footballers Kevin Keegan and Emlyn Hughes before the 1980 European Championships But when one of the worst incidents of football hooliganism broke out at a Luton Millwall match in March 1985 she acted The Football Spectators Act was passed in 1989 controversially making ID cards compulsory for fans After the Hillsborough disaster that year in which 96 Liverpool fans died the plan was never acted upon Lord Taylor s Hillsborough inquiry recommended all seater stadiums in English grounds A revolution in who watched football and how they watched it was under way When the European Economic Community began to develop far beyond a free trade agreement Thatcher s strident opposition to anything beyond a single market became a hallmark of her premiership She inspired a generation of Eurosceptics and changed the chemistry of the Tory party In much of the nation fed on a diet of Up yours Delors style headlines and expos s of life aboard the Brussels gravy train the mood gradually shifted from one of relative indifference to antipathy towards the EU Murdoch s Sun switched from backing Labour to the Tories for the 1979 election that launched Thatcher The relationship became mutually beneficial from then on as she helped him create a power base that would be threatened only 30 years later during the hacking inquiry In the early 1980s Murdoch launched a bid for the Times Group newspapers which ordinarily would have been referred to the competition authorities given his existing media holdings Instead the deal went through on the nod after private meetings between Thatcher and Murdoch at Chequers Murdoch would later revolutionise the British media defying the print unions and moving his News International media group to Wapping in an overnight coup de theatre Thatcher backed him According to cabinet minister Norman Fowler any misgivings from colleagues or supporters would be met with the response Why are you so opposed to Rupert He is going to get us in Britain was not always a country obsessed with house prices But the Housing Act of 1980 which allowed council house tenants to buy their own homes changed the face of home ownership in Britain Many former local authority tenants paid less than 10 000 for homes that would be worth 10 times that a decade later Over the next 30 years this radical move towards a nation of home owners led to a trail of unintended consequences A prolonged boom in house prices took place along with a chronic shortage of affordable housing yet to be resolved by a series of governments and the gradual emergence of a culture of debt incurred on the presumption that the value of property would keep rising In the private sector rents soared In the first half of 1988 alone house prices rose by 30 On the back of the housing boom much of Britain mortgaged itself up to the hilt and household debt reached record levels Winning the Falklands war in 1982 transformed Thatcher s standing in the opinion polls Fighting it put the armed forces back on the centre stage for the first time since Suez The Falklands revived the prestige of soldiering as huge crowds gathered to wave off and welcome home the troops in Portsmouth Later came the Gulf Kosovo Afghanistan and Iraq and the tributes to the fallen at Wootton Bassett No one talks about abolishing private schools any more Unilateral nuclear disarmament is not embraced by any of the three main political parties In 1979 as Thatcher took power the top rate of income tax was 83 The ferocious battle this year over lowering the top rate of tax from 50 to 45 illustrates how far the debate on tax has shifted Losing three times to Thatcher led directly to the creation of New Labour and the emergence of Tony Blair as a leader who embraced her emphasis on choice competition and an expanding role for the private sector in the economy Following the crash of 2007 Labour under Ed Miliband has still to decide whether to make the break from that consensus The observation that the Church of England amounts to the Tory party at prayer is thought to date to the 18th century Thatcher s terms of office severely damaged that relationship possibly beyond repair The publication in 1985 of the C of E report Faith in the City A Call to Action by Church and Nation caused an almighty political row between the church and the Conservative party which has reverberated to the present day Endorsed by Dr Robert Runcie then archbishop of Canterbury the document followed riots in Britain s inner cities It was a cry of anguish over the dilapidated alienated state of the inner cities after years of recession gloom and rising unemployment Relations between the Tories and the established church have never truly recovered Thatcher saw the BBC licence fee as a tax imposed on television viewers irrespective of whether they wanted to watch BBC programmes or not As prime minister she believed that a leftwing bias permeated its coverage During the Falklands war rightwingers renamed the corporation the Stateless Persons Broadcasting Corporation a dig at its refusal to describe British troops as our troops and Argentinian soldiers as the enemy It was hoped that the 1990 Broadcasting Act would tame the institution forcing it to outsource at least 25 of its production and allowing new players into the market But the legacy of the Thatcher era has been to drag the BBC into a perpetual culture war And she helped create Channel 4 in 1982 probably not anticipating that it would popularise fiercely anti establishment output Defeat in the Falklands war signalled the end of the road for Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri Castelli head of Argentina s last military dictatorship Thatcher s friendship with Mikhail Gorbachev helped hasten the cold war to its end as the economically moribund Soviet Union collapsed However her refusal to back sanctions on apartheid South Africa and description of Nelson Mandela as a terrorist arguably delayed the fall of that regime", "Reading this on mobile Click here to view You know what people like on telly Babies One Born Every Minute is so lovely and heartwarming So is Call The Midwife albeit

soundtracks and now the National Youth Orchestra has chosen to lead its spring programme with Erich Korngold s accompaniment to the 1935 pirate adventure Captain Blood The buccaneering score established Korngold as the Errol Flynn of studio composers though as was standard practice at the time once the footage was in the can the full score went in the bin The NYO performed a 20 minute suite by John Morgan woven together from surviving parts The stirring Captain Blood theme felt strong enough to sustain an entire symphony though whether the teenage generation of 2091 will be playing Klaus Badelt s music for the Pirates of the Caribbean remains to be seen Had Stravinsky had his way we might also be celebrating his movie soundtracks but arriving in Hollywood at the end of the second world war he couldn t get a break Instead he ignited various aborted film projects in the firestorm of the Symphony in Three Movements Whether Stravinsky intended the piece to provide a programmatic illustration of the war is inconclusive yet the unyielding rhythm of jackboots came crunching through in the final movement Never beset by false modesty Schoenberg stated that his quixotic Handelian re arrangement Concerto for String Quartet and Orchestra was mainly intent on removing the defects of the Handelian style Augmented by the excellent Navarra String Quartet conductor Simone Young carefully steered the players through the debris of this headlong collision between modernism and the baroque A majestic account of Rachmaninov s Symphonic Dances concluded this programme

during his turbulent youth in Renaissance Florence and airs on the Fox on Friday at 10pm I saw this play just off Broadway at the MC theatre club It s directed by David Cromer and written by Paul Downs Colaizzo and stars Zosia Mamet who is Shoshanna in Girls It s a beautiful brutal little play It deals with the fallout of an accusation that may or may not be true at an American college It s a sad savage exploration of this generation that has been conditioned to expect that whatever they want they deserve It s fascinating This is about the seismic shift in TV in the late 1990s just at a time when everyone thought serialised TV was dead or that the internet was going to destroy it The Sopranos and Chris Albrecht at HBO changed everything leading to shows such as Buffy Breaking Bad and The Wire etc It s fascinating not just in terms of what that says about us as a culture but what it reveals about each show from start to finish and the struggle to get these great works to the screen I saw a sneak preview of this and it looks unbelievable the costumes and the artwork the film and photography I am a huge Bowie fan I love the new album The way Where Are We Now snuck out on the sly

lush orchestral arrangements underneath it and these raw urgent beats It s beautiful He s my artist of the year so far I can t wait for the album The video is stunning too black and white shot with a phantom camera I stumbled across him two weeks ago and went Yes More of this please We re four years behind the States but it doesn t matter It s so universal and heartbreaking and hilarious It s a path into his surreal mind It s completely undefinable unclassifiable It s like if Curb Your Enthusiasm was happy but sad I just watch it it really works There are sudden moments of real melancholy that hit you in the heart Absolutely fascinating I was a giant Daniel Kitson fan for many years and there haven t been many other comedians who make me laugh out loud But Tim is divisive I ve sat behind people at his shows who have just hated it To me there s something about his profound and nonsensical poetry and his delivery What he does he s got down perfectly He could probably make the

the most talked about Top 40 since Blur took on Oasis 18 years ago at the height of 1990s Britpop But the speculation around Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead the Wizard of Oz song which became the focus of an anti Thatcher campaign on Facebook was not just about where it would chart but how much of it the BBC would play The tune from the 1939 Judy Garland film narrowly missed out on the No 1 spot in Sunday s chart finishing second to Need U the crossover house hit by Duke Dumont featuring A M E despite a last minute surge in sales After the BBC s new director general Tony Hall intervened the BBC played just a seven second clip of the song part of a news item by Radio 1 music reporter Sinead Garvan that lasted just over 90 seconds Thatcher she told listeners strongly divided opinion between those who accused her of putting millions out of work and not caring about the poor and those who believe she changed the UK for the better by taking Britain s then failing economy and making it successful She added Some politicians said it was disrespectful to play it while others say it is because she stood for freedom and allowing people to have their say There was no appearance on the news item by either Hall or Radio 1 controller Ben Cooper The song at just 51 seconds long was already the shortest ever to make the top 10 according to the Official Charts Company However in a decision which is sure to anger critics of the decision to censor the track the BBC played another song which was at the centre of a pro Thatcher campaign in full and without explanation by the presenter Jameela Jamil The 34 year old song I m in Love with Margaret Thatcher by punk band the Notsensibles charted at No 35 Former Tory MP Louise Mensch was among those who urged people to download the song which featured in Meryl Streep s 2011 Thatcher biopic The Iron Lady in protest at the Ding Dong campaign Paul Robinson a former managing editor of Radio 1 and ex head of strategy at BBC Radio was critical of the decision only to play a short clip of the Wizard of Oz track It sets a very dangerous precedent because they have taken an editorial view on a song in the Top 40 They have destroyed the idea that it is the people s chart and not the property of the BBC he said History is full of songs that were never part of Radio 1 s playlist but made it on to the chart The only issue the BBC should consider is whether the language is appropriate for the time of day the Top 40 is broadcast Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead joins a list of songs censored by the BBC including Relax by Frankie Goes to Hollywood in 1984 and God Save the Queen by the Sex Pistols which was banned in 1977 That the Sex Pistols song never made it to No 1 in the year of the Queen s silver jubilee it was held off the top spot by Rod Stewart s I Don t Want to Talk About It has always been seized on by conspiracy theorists Ding Dong sold 52 605 copies more than 18 000 of them since last Friday after controversy began to mount 5 700 behind Need U which had a weekly sale of 58 321 I m in Love with Margaret Thatcher was downloaded 8 768 times In the first test of Hall s leadership the director general said he found the anti Thatcher campaign distasteful and inappropriate But he said it would be wrong to ban the song outright as free speech is an important principle and a ban would only give it more publicity But the compromise he reached with the Radio 1 controller Cooper is in all likelihood doomed to satisfy neither Thatcher s sternest critics or her most ardent supporters", "Oscar

assiduous historical website British Television Drama records in the decade after the war 10 dramas based on the conflict The BBC screened five plays within five years of the events which may surprise those who now associate the corporation with editorial caution and at the time clearly astonished the Ministry of Defence which made numerous objections and obstructed access to actual locations and equipment The earliest pieces were oblique with Don Shaw s The Falklands Factor dramatising an 18th century dispute over the islands and Maggie Wadey s The Waiting War focusing on military and naval families ITV also enraged the MoD and the government with a children s series Jan Needle s A Game of Soldiers in which children on the island find a hiding Argentinian conscript It was documentary though that made the quickest impact on the public with Simon s War a film and various sequels about the Welsh Guard Simon Weston who was terribly injured in the attack on the troop carrier Sir Galahad However around the time of the fifth anniversary television fiction became the major battleground over how Thatcher s crusade should be recorded by broadcasters The BBC commissioned but then rejected a docu drama about the invasion from Ian Curteis one of the few TV writers of the political right Although some journalists were privately briefed that the play was of inferior quality Curteis believes that executives were unhappy with his sympathetic portrayal of Margaret Thatcher and certainly his script is alone among the Falklands dramas in not presenting the conflict as a savage and pointless colonial overhang When finally screened in 2002 to mark the 20th anniversary with Patricia Hodge supreme as Thatcher it usefully balanced TV s record of the events But the most powerful representation of the human consequences of the conflict on the British side remains Tumbledown 1988 BBC1 written by Charles Wood and directed by Richard Eyre based on the experiences during and after the conflict of the seriously injured Scots Guards officer Robert Lawrence With Colin Firth giving one of his best early performances in the central role the play was transmitted despite sustained political and military complaints that it showed only the failures of the campaign Tumbledown in common with Paul Greengrass s cinema film Resurrected 1989 raised the figure of the Falklands veteran who feels ignored by postwar society as a conscious parallel to US movies about Vietnam vets And the writer Jimmy McGovern made similar use of a Falklands vet in a 1995 episode of Cracker in which a soldier is deranged by the feeling that he fought a pointless and forgotten war The Falklands has though largely disappeared as a back story in drama mainly because the UK has been involved in many other more lengthily resonant conflicts McGovern in his last two series The Street and Accused has used vets from the Northern Ireland Afghanistan and Iraq campaigns while Ian Rankin s DI John Rebus played on TV by John Hannah and Ken Stott also saw military service in Belfast Thatcher s war now mainly gets a show in epic dramas following characters through recent British decades such as Peter Flannery s Our Friends in the North 1996 BBC1 and Paula Milne s White Heat 2012 BBC2 both of which have an episode that reflects the influence on British politics of the response to Argentina", "By Roya Nikkhah 7 00AM BST 14 Apr 2013 Comments As a stream of catchy songs floods the writing den where Sir Tim Rice is putting the final touches to his first new musical in more than 10 years it is clear he is thrilled to be heading back to the West End He looks in his element surrounded by his piano speakers and piles of typed lyrics It s exciting he says Almost like starting again Sir Tim 68 is polishing his adaptation of the 1951 James Jones novel From Here to Eternity which was made into an Oscar winning film starring Burt Lancaster Frank Sinatra and Deborah Kerr Set in Hawaii in 1941 Sir Tim s musical version due to open in the autumn is pitched as a tale of illicit love and army life telling the stories of the US soldiers stationed there in the run up to Pearl Harbor During a career that has spanned five decades and produced musicals including Chess Jesus Christ Superstar and The Lion King Sir Tim has relished working with young artists on this project The score is by Stuart Brayson whom he rates as one of the most promising talents since Andrew Lloyd Webber his writing partner of old To find a new British composer who is really good is rare he says Since Andrew there s not been a lot out there It s why people keep digging up old songs and doing jukebox musicals which are just cash ins Everyone is young in the production except for me he adds I couldn t get worked up about going back into the theatre unless it was with new people The thought of going the same old route It was down that old route with Lord Lloyd Webber that Sir Tim once formed one of the most successful musical collaborations of all time producing hits such as Evita and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat Sir Tim Rice on his new musical and working with Andrew Lloyd Webber Dad picks me up on anything I ve got wrong Sir Tim Rice Jesus Christ super feud They met in 1965 when Sir Tim aged 20 wrote to Lord Lloyd Webber 17 describing himself as a with it lyricist But since the golden age of the partnership in the late Sixties and Seventies the pair have drifted apart After Evita opened in the West End in 1978 Lord Lloyd Webber embarked on Cats based on TS Eliot s poems which didn t need a lyricist He wasn t keen to work with Sir Tim on Chess and Sir Tim didn t feel inspired to join a team of lyricists on Phantom of the Opera He has since enjoyed a lucrative career writing for Disney film productions including Beauty and the Beast Aladdin and The Lion King and Lord Lloyd Webber has produced new works including Love Never Dies and turned his hand to television shows and penning Eurovision entries The pair clashed last year over Lord Lloyd Webber s plans for a television talent show to find the next Jesus for a new production of the musical telling the story of Christ s final week which they wrote together in 1969 Sir Tim described the ITV show last summer as tacky Last month Lord Lloyd Webber opened old wounds when he bemoaned the end of their partnership appearing to blame Sir Tim In an interview with the Telegraph he said I would have loved to have had a long term writing partner like Richard Rodgers had with either Hart or Hammerstein I was really hoping that the Tim Rice relationship would have gone on I suppose the difference is that I m obsessed with theatre and for Tim it s something that he does enjoy doing is very good at but it isn t his whole life like it is with me Sir Tim is diplomatic in his response It s true musicals are definitely not the be all and end all for me As for the partnership ending I don t think we d have done anything better than we did if we d stayed together and we certainly wouldn t now A sneak preview of some of the songs from Sir Tim s new musical reveal adult themes and steamy lyrics Against a backdrop of soldiers serving in exotic climes From Here to Eternity will explore the world of escort girls and the tragedies of war I hope we re not making clunky references to modern conflicts but yes if we tell the story well people will draw parallels with today he says It ain t going to be a show for kids It s not like The Lion King or Joseph for sure Zoe is a very good touchstone she s heard it and loves it The touchstone he speaks of is his 14 year old daughter from his former partner the artist Nell Sully Sir Tim is still married to though long since separated from his wife Jane The couple have two children Eva 37 a novelist and singer songwriter and Donald 36 a film director Photographs of his six grandchildren adorn his sprawling house in Barnes alongside pictures of his beloved cricket team the Heartaches including one from a recent match at Windsor where the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh popped along for the team photo A break of more than 10 years seems like a long time away from the day job but Sir Tim says while there were many offers of stick a lyric on that would you old boy nothing grabbed him and he was happy filling his time taking on the presidency of the MCC while keeping his hand in writing bits and pieces here and there Back in the game Sir Tim has been checking out the competition I m now going to lots of shows too which I haven t done for years And what does he make of the current crop of West End musicals A few are good and a lot are terrible but I m sure I ve contributed to both parts in my time Sir Tim s back catalogue continues to be revived around the world and soon after we meet he is heading to Brazil to attend the opening of The Lion King in Sao Paulo Obviously the old stuff keeps going and probably will outlive us But if you re going to do something new nobody gives a stuff about what you ve done before If this is a total flop people might say Tim Rice over the hill clapped out Of course I want it to be a hit but it doesn t really matter for me But for Stuart it would be so great if it was a hit he deserves it In the pipeline is an idea for a musical based on the story of Machiavelli set to the hits of the Rolling Stones It s a possibility says Sir Tim I ve spoken to them about it and I shall discuss it again with Sir Mick at Lords From Here to Eternity is at the Shaftesbury Theatre

making films so long his debut on the big screen was in 1965 that his work is now being restored Yeah I ve been thinking about that Restored huh It s kind of amazing he says sitting in his production hub in downtown Manhattan the Tribeca Film Centre The restoration in question is the painstaking return to its original glory of King of Comedy Martin Scorsese s dark 1982 satire on modern celebrity obsession with its famous punchline Better to be king for a night than schmuck for a lifetime The movie has been digitally remastered from the original camera negatives and will be shown later this month on the closing night of this year s Tribeca film festival with both De Niro and Scorsese in attendance Rupert Pupkin now what film was that one De Niro quips feigning to have forgotten the part of the self delusional would be standup he played 30 years ago I haven t seen the movie in at least 20 years and I want to see it it will bring back memories not just of what I did in the movie but of that period in my life he says King of Comedy will be one of the highlights of the 2013 Tribeca film festival the celebration of New York and its movie making tradition that De Niro co founded in 2001 when the dust of the fallen Twin Towers had barely settled over Ground Zero The first festival in 2002 was framed as a form of economic stimulus the aim being to attract visitors back to lower Manhattan in the wake of the 9 11 attacks And it succeeded Each year the festival has expanded growing international tentacles until it can now claim to have screened more than 1 400 films in 80 countries including through its Arabic offshoot Doha Tribeca In the process it has comfortably achieved its initial objective generating about 750m 488m worth of economic activity for New York But therein lies a conundrum New York City is back on its feet as seen graphically in the form of the looming 1 World Trade Centre the 1 776ft skyscraper nearing completion in Ground Zero just eight blocks away from De Niro s HQ The city s revival poses De Niro together with his co founder and producer of the Tribeca film festival Jane Rosenthal with a fundamental question in its 12th year what is the festival s purpose now that its initial reason for being has been met and superseded De Niro says it remains his ambition to make the festival part of the tradition of New York part of the fabric that I hope will be what it will be in years to come and it s partially that now His love of the city and of its cinematic history remains undiminished It s given me everything I was born and raised in New York I studied acting here I love to travel but I m a New Yorker He might have added that the city also gave him his champion fellow New Yorker Scorsese who conjured many of De Niro s greatest performances in Mean Streets 1973 Taxi Driver 1976 New York New York 1977 Raging Bull 1980 Goodfellas 1990 Cape Fear 1991 and Casino 1995 De Niro recalls how he and Marty stumbled upon the look for Pupkin We were driving along Broadway and we saw this shop with mannequins with flashy clothes like you d find in places in Vegas We jumped out of the cab and went in the store and I said to Marty What do you think and he said Yeah let s take it And we took the whole thing off the mannequin even the hairstyle Tribeca film festival s struggles with its purpose in life have been exacerbated by the proliferation of movie festivals around the world and the increasingly clogged nature of the annual calendar Tribeca dubbed Hollywood on the Hudson suffers from its timing so soon after the Oscars which deprives it of the pre Oscar buzz enjoyed by Venice say or Toronto Rosenthal accepts that this is a problem It does make things more difficult and maybe if we have completed a certain mission then we would look to change the dates It s been 12 years so maybe it s time to think about it Like any festival De Niro and Rosenthal are also having to grapple with the challenge of the internet and the opportunities it offers This year they are extending across the Atlantic a films on demand experiment that has already proved successful in the US exposing independent movies to a far greater audience The technique will be rolled out to the UK from 16 April with an initial slate of six of the festival s films being offered for an eight week run on pay per view through Virgin Media and digital platforms such as iTunes PlayStation and Xbox The selected titles include Greetings from Tim Buckley a feature that explores the relationship between the father and son musicians Tim and Jeff Buckley and Fresh Meat a horror comedy that profiles a gang of dysfunctional criminals who make the less than ideal decision to kidnap a family of cannibals As a further foray into the world of digital film making at this year s festival there will be a tieup with Twitter s Vine to launch a six second film competition This will be a competition for films lasting six seconds and posted through Twitter s 6secfilms hashtag Can that really be true Robert De Niro an actor whose attention to detail is legendary lending his name to six second films I think it s great he protests It s pure

temporary 225 seat space But while I admire the scope of Ronder s piece it reveals its workshopped origins in that particular scenes strike one more forcibly than the play s total gesture Ronder uses a solidly crafted table as a way of exploring shifts in time and attitude in one family over a period of 115 years It would be impossible to summarise a dense plot that requires the help of a genealogical table but several moments make a startling impression One is the opening where we see a late Victorian Staffordshire craftsman David Best cherishing his newly made table as much as his loving bride Much later in Tanganyika in the 1950s the Best s missionary grand daughter Sarah stands atop the table and voluntarily disrobes in front of the hunter who has saved her from attack by a leopard And in south London in 2013 Sarah s globe roving son Gideon confronts the family he abandoned and now belatedly pines for These scenes are tremendous others such as the displaced Sarah s sojourn with her son in a 1960s Herefordshire commune make fun of easy targets This however typifies a play that has richly textured segments but leaves me puzzled as to the point Ronder is making What the play does prove is that non linear sagas can be staged in small spaces and Rufus Norris s production aided by English hymns and African songs moves with astonishing dexterity across continents and time and features some excellent performances Rosalie Craig as the faith seeking Sarah Paul Hilton as both her game hunting lover and restless son Daniel Cerqueira as her twin brother and Michael Shaeffer as the original Lawrentian table maker are all first rate It s an epic evening even if ultimately the parts seem greater than the whole What have you been to see lately Tell us

steps than a purposeful stride into the future But troubled Lindsay Lohan may at last be embarking on a journey to salvage her career Once hailed as one of the finest young actresses of her generation the 26 year old Lohan has seen her life swamped by allegations of drug use excessive drinking film flops and repeated trips in and out of rehab and the US judicial system She has become a salient lesson to many observers of just how badly wrong a Hollywood career can go and of the high price modern American fame can demand of the most vulnerable celebrities But last week saw that rarest of things in Lohan s recent career positive headlines On David Letterman s late night talk show Lohan was questioned about her problems including being bluntly asked Do you drink too much Lohan responded with a mix of humour seriousness and eventually a few tears She talked awkwardly about her plans to go to a rehab centre next month I don t want people to think I m making a joke of that It s not like a joking matter she said eventually earning applause from the audience Letterman gave her a handkerchief to wipe away the tears and praised her for having the courage to come on his show and talk about her issues You have enough spine enough sense of yourself enough poise to come out here and talk to me he said The response to the appearance was praise Even the sarcastic gossip website Gawker had kind things to say Humanity shines through Lindsay was witty and borderline charming for much of her chat with Dave There may be hope for her yet the website noted Other observers agreed she had done well while noting that Lohan has been here before She seemed to be slightly apologetic slightly aware But I don t think she is fully there yet said Noah Levy a senior editor and celebrity culture expert at In Touch Weekly magazine But that was not all for Lohan s rare week of happy news She appeared at the premiere of her latest movie the horror comedy Scary Movie 5 and was also a guest star on the Charlie Sheen sitcom Anger Management In that appearance Lohan played herself mentioning her brushes with the law and trouble with substance abuse in a well received parody In one scene where Lohan pretends to film a commercial for a Japanese brand of whisky flavoured chewing gum she delivered the line I m Lindsay Lohan and I love the taste of alcohol but sometimes bars close so how am I going to get that taste until they open again However few experts deny the sheer scale of the task ahead of her as she tries to rebuild her professional reputation The child and teenage star of The Parent Trap and Mean Girls has seen her recent projects hit choppy waters The art house film The Canyons in which she acted opposite porn star James Deen generated poor buzz And it follows her portrayal of Elizabeth Taylor in a made for television biopic that earned some of the worst reviews in recent TV history Levy said Lohan s main problem was that her talents and history as an actress have now been entirely subsumed by her real life dramas which dominate gossip magazines and websites that broadcast her frequent court appearances live She s created the biggest role of her life which is her life said Levy Unfortunately it is a tragedy It is also a role that is littered with problems Lohan s family background is deeply troubled Her father Michael is one of the most prominent media commentators on his daughter s travails Even last week he could be found discussing her chances of success in her coming rehab stint When asked if it would work he said Honestly I don t think so Of course Michael Lohan should know The rehab centre to which Lohan is headed is one that he himself has previously spent time in Nor is her mother Dina a much better influence In a recent appearance on the chat show Dr Phil she appeared to be confused and mumbling as she spoke about her daughter The interview was so bad that many commentators speculated she was drunk or under the influence of some other substance Levy believes that Lohan needs to break off family ties for a while and spend at least a year away from the spotlight You have to detach yourself from the negative people in your life Her mom and dad explain exactly why she is who she is If she wants to get better then she needs to stay away from her family he said But Lohan does not seem keen to take such a dramatic step not least perhaps because financial troubles appear to mean she needs to keep working She has even said that before she goes to rehab she will visit the party friendly music festival Coachella That has some critics assuming a real Lohan comeback is still on the drawing board Will we be still talking about her in 20 years Definitely But why will we be talking about her That s not decided yet said Levy",

known as an author of macabre short stories and novels he also wrote two popular detective series set almost half a century and two totally different genres apart His first novel The Dark Mirror 1966 launched a series of hard boiled thrillers featuring the Los Angeles private investigator Mike Faraday an obvious and acknowledged homage to Raymond Chandler s Philip Marlowe Critics admired Copper s authentic descriptions of the City of Angels but he had never been to California All his knowledge was gleaned from watching old movies and referring to maps Faraday s charm as a tough protagonist and poetry quoting narrator ably supported by his faithful secretary Stella proved popular The first book spawned a series and over the next 22 years Copper produced 52 volumes The books were translated into numerous foreign languages Then seven years after the death in 1973 of the US author August Derleth Copper took Derleth s Solar Pons detective series in hand Derleth had begun writing about Pons in the late 20s after Sir Arthur Conan Doyle said there would be no further tales of Sherlock Holmes Derleth s Pons a consulting detective was closely modelled on Holmes he lived in London at 7b Praed Street not far from Paddington station his own Watson was Dr Lyndon Parker and Mrs Johnson was their long suffering landlady Unfortunately Derleth s research left much to be desired and Copper was asked to revise and edit the entire series of 70 short stories and one novel The task took almost 18 months and the result was published in 1982 as The Solar Pons Omnibus Then Copper was invited to continue the Pontine canon himself and he produced seven collections of novellas and the novel Solar Pons Versus the Devil s Claw 2004 Copper s Pons stories have been collected by various publishers although the author has disowned some editions after unauthorised rewriting by inhouse editors Born in London Copper moved with his family to Kent as a boy Little Willy as he was affectionately known attended the local grammar school where he contributed fiction to the school magazine took part in amateur dramatics and was a member of a football team A voracious reader Copper also started haunting bookshops and libraries and soon discovered the works of MR James and Edgar Allan Poe At a local commercial college he learned bookkeeping economics and shorthand and touch typing Copper began training as an apprentice journalist but with the outbreak of the second world war many reporters were conscripted and he soon found himself in charge of the local newspaper branch office at the age of 17 while also serving in the Home Guard He then joined the Royal Navy and was a radio operator with a motor gunboat flotilla off the Normandy beaches during the D day operations He subsequently spent two years on radio stations in Egypt Malta and Gibraltar before demobilisation Copper resumed his career in the regional press becoming editor of the Sevenoaks edition of the Kent Messenger He made his fiction debut in The Fifth Book of Pan Horror Stories 1964 with The Spider for which he was paid 10 He then set out to write a novel a tongue in cheek crime story in the Dashiell Hammett Chandler mode The Dark Mirror was turned down by 32 publishers because it was too long before Robert Hale eventually published a cut down version Four years later in 1970 Copper gave up journalism to write full time His macabre and supernatural novels he disliked the term horror include The Great White Space 1974 Into the Silence 1983 and The Black Death 1991 along with a trio of gothics comprising The Curse of the Fleers 1976 Necropolis 1980 and The House of the Wolf 1983 the last two published by Derleth s US imprint Arkham House Two of Copper s early collections of short stories

saying he feels lucky to be alive Speaking on his own programme BBC Two s Andrew Marr Show he said he had been heavily overworking in the year before the stroke which was sparked by an intensive rowing machine session The 53 year old presenter who fell ill in January said he was doing a lot of physio to help with his walking He added he would be returning to work Appearing in a pre recorded interview on Sunday s programme the journalist and television presenter took part in a discussion on the legacy of Margaret Thatcher before talking about his illness He told guest presenter Sophie Raworth I had a major stroke I m frankly lucky to be alive I had been heavily overworking mostly my own fault in the year before that I d had two minor strokes it turned out in that year which I hadn t noticed Marr explained he had fallen into the terrible trap of believing what he read in newspapers which encouraged people to take very intensive exercise in short bursts and that s the way to health He went on I went onto a rowing machine and gave it everything I had and had a strange feeling afterwards a blinding headache and flashes of light served out the family meal went to bed woke up the next morning lying on the floor unable to move Beware rowing machines or at least beware being too enthusiastic on rowing machines would be my message to the nation he said Marr said the stroke had not impaired his voice or memory but had affected the whole left hand side of my body which is why I m still not able to walk fluently I do a kind of elegant hobble is the best I can manage my left arm isn t much good yet and I ve got a lot of physio still to do he said However the presenter added that after concentrating on a period of intensive physio he planned to return to work I m certainly coming back I ve got a lot more to say about it all but I m going to wait until I ve gone through the physio to do so Born in Glasgow Marr began his career in journalism on the Scotsman

nanny who is suing the actress for wrongful dismissal amid allegations of racism Ms Stone claims Erlinda Elemen owes 9 500 6 200 of a 12 500 8 100 loan she gave her in 2010 Ms Elemen sacked from her position as a live in nanny to the Basic Instinct star s three children in 2011 claims she was abused because she is Filipino Ms Stone denies the allegations which her publicist described as absurd The action alleges Ms Elemen who worked for Ms Stone for more than four years was repeatedly mocked for her accent and her religious beliefs The 55 year old actress tried to have the case thrown out but a judge ruled her former employee had provided enough evidence to support the charges of harassment failure to prevent harassment retaliation and wrongful dismissal Ms Elemen claims Ms Stone told her not to speak in front of her children so they would not talk like you and banned her from reading the Bible inside the actress s house The Hollywood star s lawyer Daniel Gutenplan said All we have is that Ms Stone made comments about Filipino food Filipino accents Ms Elemen who was hired in October 2006 and was promoted to live in nanny two years later claims she was dismissed in February 2011

January 2011 but stopped repayments after her dismissal The case against Ms Stone is set for 30 July", "As fans filed into Webster Hall in New York City last week a note from indie rock band the Yeah Yeah Yeahs wasted no syllables in laying down the law Please do not watch the show through a screen on your smart device camera it said along with some stronger words unrepeatable here During the gig vocalist Karen O repeated the request telling fans to take a picture right at that moment but to then keep devices hidden for the good of those around them On the web news of the band s defiance against the march of the amateur filmmaker spread and was met with whoops of delight from many music fans fed up with seeing mobiles thrust into their line of sight at every public event Many of them longed for the days when the only thing illuminating the crowd at a packed gig would be a sea of cigarette lighters held aloft during the more tender moments and not as is now more often the case the glow of the mobile phone I would never turn on a cell phone at any musical event wrote Roger Waters former bassist and vocalist for Pink Floyd People behind you are like put your phone down we can t see It would seem to me to show a lack of respect to and care for fellow concert goers or for that matter the artist Apart from anything else how could I possibly truly experience the thing I d paid to see and hear if I was fiddling with an iPhone filming or twittering or chatting or whatever To make matters worse the type of footage recorded at gigs tends to have as one Guardian journalist put it this week audio quality that would make Simon and Garfunkel sound like Slayer Sophisticated as it may be your smartphone s microphone is only capable of capturing anything and everything immediately around it But one company emerging from Dublin s blossoming start up scene thinks it has the answer and appears to have record labels on its side What our unique proprietary technology is able to do is take the poor quality on camera audio from fan videos and we analyse that and can see the patterns even though it s very weak and distorted explains Cathal Furey co founder of the firm 45sound The technology takes those patterns and matches it against what we call a master audio recording which would be a professional live audio recording from the same gig This clip shows original gig footage shot by a fan at a Deap Vally gig and then the same clip with fixed audio provided by 45sound From here clips are re uploaded with the high quality audio and in cases where there s more than one recording of the same moment fans watching the gig on 45sound can switch camera angles In recent years several sites have sought to make use of the swathes of fan footage recorded on a nightly basis Apps such as Vyclone have been used by the likes of Ed Sheeran to crowdsource gig footage with fans being encouraged to upload their recordings of Ed for it then to be edited together for the official music video Another start up OutListen gathers fan videos and if there s sufficient interest will go to record labels after a big show and request the professionally recorded audio But Mr Furey believes it is 45sound s audio matching software which gives it the edge over rivals meaning no human intervention is needed in order to whip the clips into a listenable state It s all completely automated he says What we re trying to build is a scaleable company I ll be happy when one day we do a thousand shows in one night Vital to this scalability is in building relationships with record labels To that end 45sound has the ear of several companies including Sony Music owned RCA Records One of their acts Bring Me The Horizon has been trialling 45sound on their latest tour prompting fans to record their show and upload it after the gig It compliments the whole marketing plan says Justin Cross head of digital marketing for RCA A lot of the artists we work with at RCA are live bands if you re watching someone s video of Bring Me The Horizon and you can see for yourself how fantastic they are live you re probably going to want to go and see them As part of their trial with 45sound Bring Me The Horizon s vocalist Oli Sykes prompts fans during the gig to record one particular song For those who hate people recording it may seem an irritating even inconsiderate request but it is somewhat tactical the 26 year old tells the BBC ahead of the band s gig in Bristol When we did it in Leeds the other day it was almost like it got it out of everyone s system Everyone filmed the song and then everyone put their cameras down and everyone got back into it so it was cool Meanwhile in the shivering cold outside the venue Bring Me The Horizon s fans are divided in their views of gig etiquette People behind you are like put your phone down we can t see says one female fan I think people kind of like just want to just get into it without standing around with your arm in the air all the time filming Another fan male has more enthusiasm towards the web s possibilities It s always good when people film it you can go on YouTube and see it and relive it and see all the people in the comments talking about it you can make more friends with that as well Comedian Marcus Brigstocke and Graham Lambert from Inspiral Carpets on phones at gigs For record companies like RCA Records it s a situation that requires delicate compromise says Mr Cross From a label perspective and my perspective as a fan it s something that s just part of a gig now you can t get away from it On one side of things it can be quite annoying for the fan that isn t into doing this but on the other side it s helping to push the band But 45sound s Mr Furey argues some events are just too good not to be widely shared I can definitely see that having a sea of cameras can ruin the experience Ultimately the most important person is the person who pays for a ticket to go and see the show At the same time I ve been at other events where my first reaction is who s videoing this Live music shows are an incredible human event they re very tribal very powerful very emotional So while the Yeah Yeah Yeahs join a select group of grumblers that includes the likes of Jarvis Cocker Jack White and the Stone Roses it is likely that the sea of cameras is here to stay and not just at gigs I have that problem in general life myself reflects Bring Me The Horizon s Mr Sykes I find a lot of people are documenting too much stuff rather than just living it", "British TV deployed rapidly and with frequent controversy to attack the Falklands war as a subject The assiduous historical website British Television Drama records in the decade after the war 10 dramas based on the conflict The BBC screened five plays within five years of the events which may surprise those who now associate the corporation with editorial caution and at the time clearly astonished the Ministry of Defence which made numerous objections and obstructed access to actual locations and equipment The earliest pieces were oblique with Don Shaw s The Falklands Factor dramatising an 18th century dispute over the islands and Maggie Wadey s The Waiting War focusing on military and naval families ITV also enraged the MoD and the government with a children s series Jan Needle s A Game of Soldiers in which children on the island find a hiding Argentinian conscript It was documentary though that made the quickest impact on the public with Simon s War a film and various sequels about the Welsh Guard Simon Weston who was terribly injured in the attack on the troop carrier Sir Galahad However around the time of the fifth anniversary television fiction became the major battleground over how Thatcher s crusade should be recorded by broadcasters The BBC commissioned but then rejected a docu drama about the invasion from Ian Curteis one of the few TV writers of the political right Although some journalists were privately briefed that the play was of inferior quality Curteis believes that executives were unhappy with his sympathetic portrayal of Margaret Thatcher and certainly his script is alone among the Falklands dramas in not presenting the conflict as a savage and pointless colonial overhang When finally screened in 2002 to mark the 20th anniversary with Patricia Hodge supreme as Thatcher it usefully balanced TV s record of the events But the most powerful representation of the human consequences of the conflict on the British side remains Tumbledown 1988 BBC1 written by Charles Wood and directed by Richard Eyre based on the experiences during and after the conflict of the seriously injured Scots Guards officer Robert Lawrence With Colin Firth giving one of his best early performances in the central role the play was transmitted despite sustained political and military complaints that it showed only the failures of the campaign Tumbledown in common with Paul Greengrass s cinema film Resurrected 1989 raised the figure of the Falklands veteran who feels ignored by postwar society as a conscious parallel to US movies about Vietnam vets And the writer Jimmy McGovern made similar use of a Falklands vet in a 1995 episode of Cracker in which a soldier is deranged by the feeling that he fought a pointless and forgotten war The Falklands has though largely disappeared as a back story in drama mainly because the UK has been involved in many other more lengthily resonant conflicts McGovern in his last two series The Street and Accused has used vets from the Northern Ireland Afghanistan and Iraq campaigns while Ian Rankin s DI John Rebus played on TV by John Hannah and Ken Stott also saw military service in Belfast Thatcher s war now mainly gets a show in epic dramas following characters through recent British decades such as Peter Flannery s Our Friends in the North 1996 BBC1 and Paula Milne s White Heat 2012 BBC2 both of which have an episode that reflects the influence on British politics of the response to Argentina", "Maria Tallchief who has died aged 88 was the quintessential American ballerina As the dancer Jacques d Amboise put it The English have their Fonteyn the French Chauvir the Russians Ulanova the Cubans Alonso and now the US could claim their Tallchief At the height of her career she was considered to be the most technically brilliant ballerina the US had ever produced Tallchief was indissolubly linked with some of George Balanchine s most important works The critic Francis Mason wrote Balanchine always wanted to do it his way I believe that the dancer who helped him most to do it his way the dancer who with him established the reputation of the young New York City Ballet and led the public to appreciate his ballets is Maria Tallchief She was born Elizabeth Marie Tall Chief in Fairfax Oklahoma the eldest of three children of Alexander Joseph Tall Chief of the Native American Osage tribe and his second wife Ruth who had a Scottish Irish heritage Two years later came a second daughter Marjorie who would also become a ballerina and then a son Jerry Ballet lessons began at three unhappily with an incompetent teacher But when the family moved to Los Angeles in 1933 a chance inquiry led her to an excellent studio run by Ernest Belcher She and her sister appeared in concerts and recitals although they were less than happy when performing a supposed Native American dance not least because as Tallchief explained traditionally women didn t dance in Indian tribal ceremonies They were both relieved when they outgrew the costumes When in 1938 Bronislava Nijinska opened a studio in Los Angeles the sisters moved there to study Nijinska proved to be an inspirational teacher In her studio I committed to becoming a ballerina Tallchief wrote Previously she had considered a career as a concert pianist When she auditioned for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo there was initially no vacancy but travel restrictions caused by the second world war meant that members of the company who had Nansen passports were unable to travel to Canada for performances So her professional career began By the time she was in her second season with the company she had begun to understudy leading roles and when Balanchine arrived to choreograph the dances for a production of Song of Norway his eye fell on the young woman who by then had adopted the name Maria Tallchief Balanchine continued working with the company and Tallchief was cast in a number of revivals including Le Baiser de la F e in which she danced the role of the Fairy She also created the role of the Coquette in his Night Shadow Tallchief and Balanchine married in 1946 She completed her contract with Ballet Russe and then joined him in Paris where he had a six month contract with the ballet of the Opera She became the first US dancer of the 20th century to appear on the stage of the Palais Garnier On returning to New York she took her place in 1947 as ballerina with Ballet Society the group formed by Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein that eventually became New York City Ballet There she was to dance in virtually all Balanchine s ballets Many of the roles in which he cast her were designed to extend her technique and artistry and transform her into the prototype Balanchine ballerina Tallchief recalled how after six years dancing for him the very proportions of my body the configuration of my legs and torso were different Among the ballets in which Tallchief created leading roles were Symphonie Concertante Orpheus Firebird Bourr e Fantasque Scotch Symphony Allegro Brillante and Gounod Symphony plus his version of Swan Lake She was also the first Sugar Plum Fairy in Balanchine s Nutcracker In 1965 she left New York City Ballet because as she said I will accept alphabetical billing but I will not be treated alphabetically She had already taken leave of absence to dance with Ballet Russe at the highest salary ever then paid to a dancer Her marriage to Balanchine had been annulled on the grounds that he did not want children A brief marriage to Elmourza Natirboff was dissolved and in 1956 she married Henry Buzz Paschen She gave birth to their daughter Elise in 1959 Tallchief was inducted into the National Women s Hall of Fame and received a Kennedy Centre honour and the National medal of arts Her husband died in 2004 Tallchief is survived by Elise now a distinguished poet two grandchildren and her sister Maria Tallchief ballerina born 24 January 1925 died 11 April 2013", "By Rupert

between Indian music and flamenco This was her first London appearance since the death of her father Ravi Shankar and she began with a raga that he taught her when she was still a teenager It began slowly and gradually developed into a lively piece that provided an instant reminder of her remarkable skill Then came her own compositions mixing passages of virtuoso playing with Indian Spanish fusion work that ranged from the passionate to the easygoing Most of the set was devoted to material from her latest album Traveller She started with a drifting atmospheric mood piece featuring the oboe like shenai but then brought on two flamenco performers the singer Sandra Carrasco and guitarist El Mel n The best songs featured intense interplay between sitar and guitar either playing together or echoing phrases while on Dancing in Madness the sitar was matched against the Latin caj n box drum It was a slick classy show that was helped by an adventurous finale in which the

As with Yeah Yeah Yeahs yesterday the 8pm mainstage slot seems to be the one to watch no pressure tomorrow Vampire Weekend and the crowd respond in joyous fashion even providing their own DIY

attempts to buy it back from a private collector failed Child With A Dove was sold last year for a reported 50m but the government placed an export bar on the work in the hope a British buyer could be found The ban expired in December with no institution able to raise the funds Lord Inglewood chairman of the Arts Council managed Reviewing Committee called the loss a great shame He said Child With A Dove is an iconic Picasso painting and has a long history in British collections It is one of Picasso s key early works and marks a transitional moment in his career the move into his much celebrated Blue Period It is a great shame that institutions could not raise the funds necessary to keep this beautiful piece of art in this country But this is exactly why export bars are so very important in protecting the nation s cultural heritage In the case of the Picasso clearly money was the problem Lord Inglewood added In the case of the Picasso clearly money was the problem and while steps are being taken to increase philanthropy in the country this suggests they may not be enough According to French newspaper Le Figaro Child With A Dove had been bought by a collector in Qatar The Arab

family in Wales who were bequeathed the painting in 1947 following the death of Samuel Courtauld It first came to Britain in 1924 when it was bought by Mrs R A Workman One of the earliest and most important works by Picasso to enter a British collection it marks a transition into the artist s celebrated Blue Period when he moved away from a broadly Impressionistic style to a more sparing aesthetic creating sombre works painted almost solely in shades of blue and blue green In the 1970s the painting was loaned to the National Gallery in London and last year it went on display in the

the Musical has been praised by critics for its marvellous opening night on Broadway in New York The Roald Dahl adaptation was called the best family musical in years in the Chicago Tribune s review The New York Times said the production from the Royal Shakespeare Company was the most satisfying and subversive musical ever to come out of Britain The musical written by Dennis Kelly and Tim Minchin was a blast of nasty fun according to the Associated Press It would be easy to call it the best British musical since Billy Elliot but that I m afraid would be underselling it said Richard Zoglin in TIME Magazine You have to go back to The Lion King to find a show with as much invention spirit and genre re defining verve Zoglin wrote in his review Led by British director Matthew Warchus the production was not changed for an American audience a risk that the Financial Times said paid off This production offers a marvellous escape from the usual Broadway musical fare Brendan Lemon said in the FT review Most of the roles were re cast for the Broadway show but each of the four actresses playing Matilda were trained to speak with a British accent Actor Bertie Carvel who received high praise for his performance as the tyrannical headmistress Miss Trunchbull in the West End has transferred to play the role in New York He has now received critical acclaim from American reviewers for his deliciously malevolent performance which was a seismic force according to the Chicago Tribune The musical was an edge of the seats nail biter according to the Ben Brantley in the New York Times who likened it to a season finale episode of terrorist drama Homeland The West End production broke records last year winning seven Olivier Awards including the youngest recipient for 10 year old

small town on the Patagonian coast carrying the first Argentinian troops to have laid down their weapons after their commander surrendered to British forces in the Falklands With their heads bowed the 4 000 Argentinian conscripts marched silently to the nearby Lahusen barracks where they were discharged from duty and told to return to their homes Argentina s 11 000 Falklands veterans were not greeted as heroes but shunned by the dictatorship as reminders of an embarrassing defeat And when Argentina returned to democracy a year later they were widely seen as tainted by their association with the reviled military junta Former soldiers who went to war as teenagers were left to rebuild their shattered lives by themselves There were 649 Argentinian servicemen killed in the war and a further 350 veterans have reportedly killed themselves since but their story has been widely ignored as the war faded in a kind of collective amnesia Now a group of young film makers is seeking to change that with Argentina s first TV drama about the Falklands conflict Combatientes or Fighters draws on interviews with veterans to tell the fictional story of five conscripts and an officer before during and after the war as the protagonist Gustavo Ribero tries to remember what happened to him on the final night on the islands Written and directed by Tom s de las Heras 29 and Jeronimo Paz Clemente 31 it was aired on the state TV channel Canal 7 As members of a generation that did not live through the dictatorship De las Heras and his team felt the time had come to reconsider the war s legacy and offer alternatives to the politically charged dispute over the islands The idea of the series was to explore the soldiers heroism in the face of hunger loss and exclusion rather than to glorify the war and the motives behind it The problem we faced was how to talk about heroism in the context of the defeat without being pro war De las Heras said So we started thinking about how to express that heroism and we felt that the companionship and help they offered to one another in times of hunger and cold had to be the focus We wanted to talk about their personal struggle and how they helped each other to survive By using an army official as a lead character De las Heras hoped it would mark the start of a dialogue in society We have the opportunity to mend the animosity between the people and the army This is a country with a long history of military coups To have a protagonist who is a lieutenant and then try and humanise him was a risk But I think there is less danger in speaking about these things than being silent In its first week Fighters was Canal 7 s second most watched programme and praised for its unprecedented quality Viewers took to Facebook and Twitter to commend the producers for creating an Argentinian Band of Brothers On a military forum Falklands veterans praised the drama s accuracy and attention to detail One reason it has taken so long to produce a Falklands themed drama is because Argentina s TV output is dominated by cheap but popular telenovelas or soap operas Fighters won a competition and secured the 1 6m pesos 200 000 budget provided by the government through the National Institute for Audio visual Arts and Cinema and the University of San Mart n The military then donated the props and let the team film for nothing at Campo de Mayo the army s largest military base The writer admitted the diplomatic tension between Argentina and Britain as well as the publicity surrounding the 30th anniversary of the Falklands war may have helped with funding Although a first for television the Falklands war has featured in a handful of Argentinian films and several novels and documentaries But the team behind Fighters said that most past portrayals had been too politicised Some productions are so close to the political and the organic fabric of the war that the narrative is consumed by the need to describe the historical process I don t want to say they were propagandistic because it sounds aggressive but the narrative was lost De las Heras said We didn t want to vindicate the veterans politically or socially That pain is deeply personal and can only be understood by those who went there We need to look at it in a personal human way because politics and propaganda desensitises guardian co uk today

analysis and rather shorter on solutions but it makes compelling reading Contrary to the endless bleating from coalition ministers about Gordon Brown s debt and the mess that Labour left us Peston is clear where the blame lies It was the bankers stupid Plus the fact that for many years we in the rich world have been living beyond our means our lifestyles funded by surpluses from countries such as China and the oil producers that kept their savings in British banks until the fateful day 9 August 2007 when the bond markets ceased to function For page after page Peston describes the various scams the bankers were into the massive over leveraging the invention of more and more complex and socially useless financial products all fuelled by a toxic bonus culture The one thing they weren t keen on and this has been the case for decades was investment in productive activity manufacturing investment in Germany is 12 times that of the UK The tone is conversational The reader is addressed throughout in the first person which can be irritating I am going to get pedagogic on you but overall it is a lucid expert account of a disaster in which we all have a stake and which is by no means over If the euro goes down we are all in deep shtuck As for solutions there are no easy fixes Regulate the banks by all means break them up even although bear in mind that the City is one of the few areas of the British economy that still turns in a surplus Insist that if multinationals want to do business here they will have to pay our taxes Tilt the economy back in the direction of making things again and adjust higher education accordingly Above all Peston s message is that we may all have to adjust our expectations and prepare for a long period of low growth until we develop

Emily Watson as two senior politicians who are married to one another and whose domestic life starts to unravel when the husband s career begins to be eclipsed by that of his more talented wife If this is a fantasy and none too flattering version of Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper s lives then at least they can be happy with the cast It s a mark of how much the star of TV drama has risen that an actor of Emily Watson s stature is involved Ever since she was nominated for an Oscar for her debut role in Lars von Trier s mesmerising and disturbing Breaking the Waves she s worked with some of Hollywood s most interesting names Paul Thomas Anderson who went on to direct the Oscar studded There Will Be Blood wrote Punch Drunk Love for her Steven Spielberg cast her in War Horse Robert Altman picked her to be his world weary housemaid Elsie in Gosforth Park She was nominated for another Oscar for her role in Hilary and Jackie the story of Jacqueline du Pr so to have her popping up in a BBC drama is something of a surprise and a delight But then it s as dark and vengeful as a Jacobean revenge tragedy at times a gripping political psychodrama and while Ed Balls can dream and only dream of having the sex appeal of David Tennant even aged up with ridiculous TV character hair it really ought to have had some lines of its own it s that arresting there is a certain quietly competent Yvette Cooper air that hovers around Emily Watson s performance Did Watson study her at all No Not specifically I mean I think Paula Milne the writer had that couple in mind But it s not supposed to be them or anybody specifically There are quite a lot of frontrunners at the moment who are women on both sides So I think that s quite interesting and what it does to a relationship when both partners want the top job She s right It is quite interesting And the marriage of the Balls Coopers is an inherently dramatic starting point in a Borgen meets The Borgias sort of a way What s more it s a drama with a backstory back in 1995 at the height of John Major s government when Back to Basics was the policy of the day and barely a week went by without some minister being caught with his mistress Milne wrote The Politician s Wife It was a huge hit for Channel 4 winning Baftas and Emmys and one of the factors no doubt that influenced Watson to take the role though she says she just read the script And I thought Ooh that s quite tasty Tasty in that Yvette and Ed or Aiden and Freya as they re called in this scenario are ambitious enough and ruthless enough to try and stitch each other up Despite having two children and a home together Aiden becoming unhinged when his wife replaces him in the cabinet She s quite an unusual female character says Watson in that she s very sexual but a faithful wife and mother And she s very ambitious and political but has the emotional intelligence to play a very subtle hand It s quite complex and I just enjoyed playing her And you know she had brushed hair and suits and make up and all that Really I say You liked the lady politician viscose blouses But that is true to life If you look at women in politics they all dress like men The currency of your sexuality is not you can t take it to work Whereas obviously in my job it s a big part of what I do It s a big part of who I am and there s no denying it Whereas I think in the political world you have to very strictly leave that at home And I think any politician who tries to be sexual or feminine is diminished It s an interesting observation particularly given Watson s career At 46 she says she plays a lot of mums these days Which is fine I am a mum after all She has two children Juliet seven and Dylan four in real life and on screen she was recently the mother in War Horse And she s currently commuting back and forth to Berlin where she s playing another maternal role in The Book Thief But in many ways her defining role and the one that first brought her to public attention was highly sexualised that of Bess in Breaking the Waves It was an extraordinary film and Watson was extraordinary in it It s funny she says a few days ago the Book Thief s director Brian Percival said to me Oh I watched Breaking the Waves again over the weekend And I was like Really I mean really Why It s just so extreme and so powerful and raw It was raw Watson played the role as if she d had her skin sheared off and maybe she had in a way it was her first film I had nothing to compare it to she says and when von Trier told her to open herself up to the role playing a naive God fearing Scottish girl whose husband suffers a grisly industrial accident and insists she goes out and sleep with other men it s exactly what she did How does it feel watching it now Do you still feel like that young wide eyed girl Well I wasn t that wide eyed really I was 28 and I d been to university I d been in the theatre I just managed to pull it off and make it look like I was But yes I look back on that and it was absolutely a shatteringly life changing experience It was huge It was a monumental experience not just in the making of the film but in the effect that it then had on my life It propelled her into the Hollywood elite And yet curiously not in a way I come across an old cutting that compared her with Kate Winslet The only two young British actresses who have genuine heavy weight status in America it claimed It seems unlikely that you d bracket the two of them together these days Watson has made her life in southeast London not Hollywood and has been married for nearly two decades Whereas Winslet has made let s say other choices There was a point where I was thinking about moving to LA says Watson I physically enjoy the place But it s the mental life you have to negotiate living there I just don t think I have the equipment to deal with it Her decisions have had their own stresses though As a jobbing actor before her big break she met and married fellow actor Jack Waters and while her career achieved super stratospheric lift off her husband just never quite got the break In The Politician s Husband Watson s character s growing ambition and career focus coupled with her husband s lack of success leads to a troubled female guilt male emasculation dynamic It s a tricky question to ask but have there been any parallels It s a very different scenario because being an artist you re not It doesn t have that same climbing a structure thing it s much more fluid And it s very much a part time job so when I m home I m very content to be the cooker and the washer Obviously I ve had a career that he hasn t had so that is an imbalance but as you get older I just feel that you don t have to judge your life by other people s standards It s what you make of it You just have to love the life you re in really These days she says the roles she accepts are entirely influenced by the impact they have on her family My career is totally controlled by that she says It s a huge part of my decision making process Where is it How long And how much Because if it s independent low budget no money eight weeks fantastic script sorry It has to be worth my while leaving for that long To keep everybody in nannies and school fees The geography issue is presumably why she has started to turn up in certain TV dramas She co starred with Dominic West last year in the Fred West drama Appropriate Adult for which she won a Bafta In the YouTube clip of it she looked genuinely stunned as opposed to faux oh my God actorly stunned and admits that she found it incredibly gratifying I ve just been to so many of those things and never won It was a bit of a monkey off my back But the role she s playing now she says of the multitasking mum is one she s enjoying Though it can be a bit surreal A day or two ago she d played a woman waving her husband off to the front in Nazi Germany And then I m driving back from the Polish border to get the late flight from Berlin and then going straight to Juliet s school play in the morning It can be a bit odd Somebody once told her that actors bodies can t distinguish between fiction and reality between invented emotion and real And I m sitting there and I have to remember that there s nothing wrong It s all good The Nazis aren t coming It s just London s Burning on the recorder The Politician s Husband is on BBC2 on 25 April at 9pm", "By Maureen Lipman 6 17PM BST 13 Apr 2013 Comments Last week s news was all about Margaret Thatcher Let me add to it The year is 1973 and I m newly wed and gainfully employed in the West End in a No l Coward triple bill of limitless frivolity Much of my spare time though is spent in a custom made platinum wig and navy suit carrying a dangerous handbag while purring Let me obfuscate one thing perfectly clearly I went on chat shows impersonating the future prime minister s thunderous tones and even once mounted the hustings with Neil Kinnock which surprised us both My late husband Jack once drove me placard and all to the Industrial Relations Bill demo then got stuck for three hours in the traffic caused by the march and his wife The reason I remember these episodes so well is that I ve told the stories so often transcribed them in print and seen the photographs I can t remember much else from those days including my own honeymoon because it didn t become an anecdote to reinforce and or embroider over the years I just know from family folklore that we left the baronial hotel we d booked into in Climping and headed happily for a big old seafront hotel in Bognor Regis and lots of Scrabble I worry about my memory With good reason The Lipmans were quick witted and sharp but you didn t ask Dad who was a tailor for whom he d promised to make a wedding suit or why at my own wedding he forgot to walk me down the aisle Shortly after my parents honeymoon bored by what he termed a woman s film at the Regal Cinema in Hull he left my mother dabbing her eyes at William Holden and went to play snooker After the film she waited in vain for him to pick her up It turned out he d gone home to his mother having completely forgotten he was married All good funny family stuff But at the age of 68 my father went into the Masonic Hospital in Ravenscourt Park west London for a minor operation All seemed well when we went to see him and we left him happily complaining about the grub Two days later he didn t know what day it was Literally We ll never know what happened In those days one didn t ask let alone sue A series of strokes a deprivation of oxygen such theories were airily bandied about but the facts remained unclear Somewhere along the line Maurice had lost his short term memory and for the next 15 years he lived without it My mother initially fell apart but both went on to deal with the weirdness of it surprisingly well Still with the loss of his memory I also lost the father I knew A proper fully functioning brain gives us confidence and makes us what we are Maureen Lipman curses Harry Potter star Maureen Lipman takes a swipe at John Cleese Maureen Lipman on Network Maureen Lipman s Zakynthos From that moment I thought to myself I must look after my memory We are all living so much longer these days that five per cent of people over the age of 65 already have Alzheimer s At 66 my memory is acute enough to retain almost all my lines in a play for instance Yet I can read a book love it but have to remind myself afresh every night who the characters are So when the BBC suggested I present a documentary I said the only thing I really wanted was to explore properly what memory is And what I can do to keep mine as robustly selective as it has always been Along the way I made some surprising revelations I visited a primary school for instance and found out from an expert that as a rule we don t form memories until we are three This is not just because our neurons and synapses aren t yet developed but also because without language and narrative drive we don t have the ability to store them The pupils at the school proved this theory from the age of three children start using fully formed sentences and because they can now start telling stories about their life they can also start remembering them in the case of the five year olds in the programme the stories tumble out hilariously By the time we reach our teens we are beginning to discover who we really are I visited my old school Newland School for Girls in Hull and got misty eyed with my old pals as we belted out the school song which we could all recall word perfectly Why is it we remember so much from this time when I struggle to remember what I did last week Enter the expert who set us a series of school related memory questions that revealed the existence of a reminiscence bump This is a sudden expansion in the brain and a laying down of memories that peaks in adolescence and defines us for ever Essentially our most vivid memories come from the period between the ages of 15 to 25 This is the last period of the formation of the self when the child is turning themselves to life outside the family The brain during these ages is shaping itself up especially the frontal lobes an area that represents important aspects of the self Many of us still define ourselves through the young adult years our favourite films music still come from that time We did other experiments too Along with the actor Larry Lamb a game geezer if ever there was one I partook in an experiment to learn 25 faces names and birthdays from photographs of complete strangers in the same week as he was opening in panto in Derby and I was dress rehearsing a new play at Hampstead We were taught visualisation techniques to help us This works well because nearly a quarter of our brain deals with the process of visual information And Paul McKenna did a spot of EMDR eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy on me the actual form of which can t be screened for fear that our viewers might go gaga and sue but the result raises fascinating questions about brainwashing This particular form of therapy can swap memories around so the bad memories at the forefront of our minds can be swapped with good ones at the back Relearning the way we process memories makes you realise how easy it is to manipulate the brain This can also help victims of post traumatic stress and hearing two of such people talking about the vivid daily horror of flashbacks I wanted to shout Camera go away Leave it on them not me Without comment This disorder teaches us about the sheer brute strength of a memory It was originally associated with soldiers but is now thought to affect 30 per cent of all people who have been through a traumatic event For the documentary I also held a human brain in my hands and marvelled at how this waxen cauliflower can control and direct every move I make and every thought I suppress I am my memory Quite the finest day of filming which took several weeks and was something of a challenge was spent with my friend the photographer Elsbeth Juda who turns 102 in May She shows us her pilates routine and tells us how she tries to do something fresh and interesting every day What you won t hear because ironically there is no room for reminiscing is that her German philosopher father made her learn a poem write a story or play a piano piece and present it to him every day after school in his office Elsbeth is a living affirmation of the staying power of being eternally curious and learning by rote Michael Gove will be punching the air On the day of mine and Larry s test to put names and birth dates to 25 photos I sat in my kitchen using the physician Michael Mosley s visualisation retention methods I tested myself eyes half shut like a kid doing revision and to my astonishment I remembered 17 names Somewhat pleased with myself I was about to start on the dates Then I heard a gurgling splashing sound I d remembered 17 out of 25 names but totally forgotten that I d left the bath running Now where did I put that drawing board Maureen Lipman If Memory Serves Me Right will be on BBC One on Thursday at 9pm"]
